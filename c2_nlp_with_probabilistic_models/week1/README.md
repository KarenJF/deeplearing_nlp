## How to build a simple Autocorrect System
In this folder, I built a simple but still good enough autocorrect system to correct misspelled words. 

### What is Autocorrect: 
It’s an application that changes misspelled words into the correct ones. 

### Detailed Steps: 
1. Identify a misspelled word. 
One way to identify misspelled words is to check the word in a dictionary. If the word is not found, it’s probably a misspelled word.
