This is a repository to document my notes for the **Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models course** on Coursera. My certification for this course is here: [See Link](https://coursera.org/share/dacae8cfae8de5f2b0e21e35802ed52d)

**NOTE:**
I use some of the course material figures in my notes. The figures credits all goes to the course copy-right.
