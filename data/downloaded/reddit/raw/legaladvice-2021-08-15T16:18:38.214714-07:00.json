I finally got three calls from them today; two were voicemails asking me to call back to schedule the appointment and a third was clearly unintended. What I heard was a two and a half minute conversation of a group of secretaries basically making fun of my medical history. It was, more or less: \n\"Is that (me) calling back? I just called him. He has a referral for urology and they were making him wait while they verified his financial information so you know, it's his fault anyway (laughter and agreement from three others). Yeeeaaaah it's his fault. He can't walk, he can barely function. Oh well. I mean I guess it is our fault because we didn't contact him earlier. (Someone in the back says 'yeeaaaah that's our fault'). Let's see here... (Name of old hospital) ... Behavioral health, ooooh suicidal? SHI? What's that stand for... I know the S is suicide... \n(Someone in the back: self harm initiative?) \n... No suicide... Homicide? Suicide homicidal? (Someone in the back: \"I really don't think that stands for homicidal...\") \nWell you never know, I mean he could be homicidal too! (more laughter from three others). This was for (name of old hospital) behavioral health... Probably homicidal.\" And then they must have realized they were leaving a message. They hung up. End of message. The long and short of why I'm here is that what they were referencing was a horrible point in my life wherein I checked myself into a psych ward worried about my mental health, that was about seven years ago. I've never been homicidal in my entire life. These humans were joking about a mental health crisis a mentally ill patient had over half a decade ago, my financial situation, as well as a few other quips during the nearly three minute voicemail. I have no idea what to do. I feel absolutely mortified. I know I need to call and inform someone, and I did when I called back to schedule the appointment. I told the secretary about the voicemail I received from her office and she sounded equally mortified, asked me if I wanted to speak to 'her supervisor'. I declined thinking it best to get advice from anyone before talking to anyone on their end about this. The call was basically a bunch of people laughing at my expense the entire time. I feel like I can't walk into my doctor's office knowing that the secretaries  at reception feel that way about the patients they see. I'm already looking into a different primary care provider despite being, otherwise, happy with my current one. I feel like I was bullied over a voicemail about the worst point in my life by individuals in an environment meant to make patients feel welcomed and safe. I have the voicemail saved, downloaded, backed up twice. Do I just contact HR and email them the voicemail? Should I be contacting an attorney? I feel so damned lost. All day I've just been shifting from awful anger to bouts of crying. Thanks for your time, should anyone find this.",

If thier inspection doesn't pass their approval, and they put me on the hook for cleaning or repair fees, is it my responsibility to pay them with my out of pocket money, or is it their responsibility to get ahold of my security deposit still on file with the previous landlord as payment? \n\nI don't know the law here, but my feeling is since I already have a security deposit tucked away in the contract, then it is up to the receivership to first access to security deposit to pay off any debts I may have. \n\nThoughts?",

The car has heated and cooled seats, they also spread the same oil in the speakers. Dealership sued me for the 1,000 out of the 3,000 down I had my bank get back for me.

Neighbors all claim they have gone to check her house and there is no one there, no sign anyone but Diane has been there, she has zero signs of physical trauma, ligature marks or any of the stuff she would have if there was in fact men trying to tie her down and hold her hostage\u2026\n\nNeighbors claim she has been acting erratic and showing signs of mental decline for a little while, and I know she suffers from a host of medical issues like autoimmune disorders so I\u2019m not sure if maybe whatever is going on is related to that or she just has early onset dementia given her age, or something else. She is one of those stubborn people who would never admit to her mental faculties being diminished in any capacity and we aren\u2019t super close with her so hence why we are so out of the loop on everything.\n\nSo now we are driving out to California to see what the hell is going on because the neighbors insisted we do so, they are all very concerned and frankly it seems they\u2019re tired of having to look after her. \n\nThe legal advice I\u2019m looking for is, I have no idea what we are looking at here. I have a feeling that this might turn into a situation where we might need to basically get her committed somewhere against her will and take over her assets since she might be having some kind of episodes where she isn\u2019t always lucid, and if so then she isn\u2019t capable of caring for herself. I know most likely this would be a case of getting my boyfriend appointed as her power of attorney so he can make medical decisions for her and control her assets in case we need to hire help like a nurse to look after her or maybe even getting her checked in to some facility where she can be care for around the clock. This would preferably also be in our home state of AZ since it is admittedly much harder to look in on her from out of state\u2026\n\nI just don\u2019t really know the procedure for doing all of this when she will probably put up a fight the moment she realizes what is going on. I feel like we will probably have to essentially get an attorney and gather official testimony from the neighbors who have been helping her the past couple months. Diane is the kind of person who would be extremely offended if anyone ever questioned her sanity and she will likely be the very opposite of cooperative in all of this, so I just need to know how this will all work (from anyone who has dealt with this kind of thing personally or professionally preferably) - also I was wondering what kind of attorney would I even look for in all of this?",

Neighbors all claim they have gone to check her house and there is no one there, no sign anyone but Diane has been there, she has zero signs of physical trauma, ligature marks or any of the stuff she would have if there was in fact men trying to tie her down and hold her hostage\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neighbors claim she has been acting erratic and showing signs of mental decline for a little while, and I know she suffers from a host of medical issues like autoimmune disorders so I\u2019m not sure if maybe whatever is going on is related to that or she just has early onset dementia given her age, or something else. She is one of those stubborn people who would never admit to her mental faculties being diminished in any capacity and we aren\u2019t super close with her so hence why we are so out of the loop on everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we are driving out to California to see what the hell is going on because the neighbors insisted we do so, they are all very concerned and frankly it seems they\u2019re tired of having to look after her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The legal advice I\u2019m looking for is, I have no idea what we are looking at here. I have a feeling that this might turn into a situation where we might need to basically get her committed somewhere against her will and take over her assets since she might be having some kind of episodes where she isn\u2019t always lucid, and if so then she isn\u2019t capable of caring for herself. I know most likely this would be a case of getting my boyfriend appointed as her power of attorney so he can make medical decisions for her and control her assets in case we need to hire help like a nurse to look after her or maybe even getting her checked in to some facility where she can be care for around the clock. This would preferably also be in our home state of AZ since it is admittedly much harder to look in on her from out of state\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don\u2019t really know the procedure for doing all of this when she will probably put up a fight the moment she realizes what is going on. I feel like we will probably have to essentially get an attorney and gather official testimony from the neighbors who have been helping her the past couple months. Diane is the kind of person who would be extremely offended if anyone ever questioned her sanity and she will likely be the very opposite of cooperative in all of this, so I just need to know how this will all work (from anyone who has dealt with this kind of thing personally or professionally preferably) - also I was wondering what kind of attorney would I even look for in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Two weeks prior to the move in date, one of our friend's (not the one in question) let's call him Jake. Jake called us up and said \"Hey guys, I'm bailing on the lease, my mom doesn't want me to move in with yall\" Kinda ticked off about that, we moved on and found a replacement for him. Jake agreed to pay the initial utility deposit for getting everything turned on. Trevor was pissed and said \"Yeah, he better pay the utility deposit, he already signed the lease.\" We had to sign an updated lease for the replacement roommate the day of move in. Trevor signed the lease, and called us about 3 hours later and said \"Yeah, I'm gonna bail on the lease as well\" THE DAY OF MOVE IN. Trevor is now ignoring me when I ask for the utility deposit money that he still owes me, because in his words \"He already signed the lease\"\n\nPrior to all of this, I agreed to rent out a storage unit for the four of us to put our stuff in for two weeks, (tl;dr our other apartment lease ended on the 31st, new one didn't start till the 13th) I'm currently torn as to what I should do, as not getting this utility deposit from him will cause a serious money issue on our end, as we'd have to split his deposit 3 ways. Which is just unfair for all of us. I have been considering changing the padlock on the storage unit, and keeping his stuff hostage until I receive Trevor's utility payment. Am I legally allowed to do this? (The storage unit is in my name) and what other course of action could I take here? I've spoken to him in person and asked for it and he just says \"Yeah I'll send it later\" and never does. I've tried being civil with him, but It's gotten to the point that he's just blatantly disrespecting me, and I don't think words by themselves will solve this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: There is no written agreement stating that he needs to pay me for the utilities.\n\nEdit: This is in Texas",

If I haven\u2019t actually &lt;em&gt;SEEN&lt;/em&gt; anyone, what can I possibly do? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Found evidence of trespassers on large property, but haven\u2019t seen anyone. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Hey all. NYC. tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nBack in Oct 2019, a property tax payment I made for my house vanished into thin air. The next quarter (Jan 2020), I was overdue on the amount I'd already paid plus the regular payment.\n\nNow, as far as I know, I really did make that payment. I use an online billing system that sends my money directly to the NYCDOF from my bank. I wait for my bill to arrive in the mail, dutifully enter the exact amount due into said system, and schedule it before the due date. I've been doing this for over 20 years and have never had any issue or missed/late payments before.\n\nEver since then I've been trying to get in contact with the NYCDOF and explain the situation. Every time I called 311 or emailed the NYCDOF, I got the same response - \"send us evidence of your payment through snail mail\" (paraphrasing), with an address to the Refunds Unit (which can be found by going to \"Payments not Posted\" [here](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01251)).\n\nI don't know what else evidence to provide aside from snapshots/photocopies of my bank transactions, which show that I indeed became \\[property tax amount\\] poorer after a payment was made to the DoF in 10/2019, as well as showing previous payments to that same payee for the property tax bills that *were* paid off. \n\nSo I've been sending these letters to the given address for all of 2020 and 2021 and they've pretty much all fallen into black holes as well. \n\nFunnily enough, in my bill for May 2020, the overdue amount was actually cleared and I thought it was over. Then the quarter right after that, the same thing happened. I have no clue what on earth is going on with whoever's processing my taxes/letters at this point - if they'd actually received one of my letters and read it or not. \n\nIn hindsight it was probably foolish of me not to take this problem more seriously earlier on, or at least pay the \"overdue\" amount anyways so once I get this all sorted out I can just get credit for it. But I didn't have an extra couple grand to throw at a problem that (I 99% am confident on) wasn't my fault back in 2020.\n\nMy latest property tax bill arrived today and not only does it still have the overdue amount, they're also starting to charge interest on it now. Sending paper letters to them seems to be doing jack-all and every time I try to email or call them they just tell me, \"SeND Us PaYmEnt EviDencE iN tHe MaIl\". At this point I think I need to get a lawyer involved just so my problem can be **heard**. Is there any recourse left for me besides this?\n\nThanks. \n\n**TL;DR -** I paid my property tax back in 10/2019 but the NYCDOF thinks otherwise and keeps charging me for an overdue sum that shouldn't exist. All attempts to correspond with them has disappeared into a black hole and they're starting to charge interest. What options are left aside from getting a lawyer involved?",

NYC. tl;dr at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in Oct 2019, a property tax payment I made for my house vanished into thin air. The next quarter (Jan 2020), I was overdue on the amount I&amp;#39;d already paid plus the regular payment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, as far as I know, I really did make that payment. I use an online billing system that sends my money directly to the NYCDOF from my bank. I wait for my bill to arrive in the mail, dutifully enter the exact amount due into said system, and schedule it before the due date. I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for over 20 years and have never had any issue or missed/late payments before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since then I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get in contact with the NYCDOF and explain the situation. Every time I called 311 or emailed the NYCDOF, I got the same response - &amp;quot;send us evidence of your payment through snail mail&amp;quot; (paraphrasing), with an address to the Refunds Unit (which can be found by going to &amp;quot;Payments not Posted&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01251\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what else evidence to provide aside from snapshots/photocopies of my bank transactions, which show that I indeed became [property tax amount] poorer after a payment was made to the DoF in 10/2019, as well as showing previous payments to that same payee for the property tax bills that &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; paid off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been sending these letters to the given address for all of 2020 and 2021 and they&amp;#39;ve pretty much all fallen into black holes as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, in my bill for May 2020, the overdue amount was actually cleared and I thought it was over. Then the quarter right after that, the same thing happened. I have no clue what on earth is going on with whoever&amp;#39;s processing my taxes/letters at this point - if they&amp;#39;d actually received one of my letters and read it or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In hindsight it was probably foolish of me not to take this problem more seriously earlier on, or at least pay the &amp;quot;overdue&amp;quot; amount anyways so once I get this all sorted out I can just get credit for it. But I didn&amp;#39;t have an extra couple grand to throw at a problem that (I 99% am confident on) wasn&amp;#39;t my fault back in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My latest property tax bill arrived today and not only does it still have the overdue amount, they&amp;#39;re also starting to charge interest on it now. Sending paper letters to them seems to be doing jack-all and every time I try to email or call them they just tell me, &amp;quot;SeND Us PaYmEnt EviDencE iN tHe MaIl&amp;quot;. At this point I think I need to get a lawyer involved just so my problem can be &lt;strong&gt;heard&lt;/strong&gt;. Is there any recourse left for me besides this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR -&lt;/strong&gt; I paid my property tax back in 10/2019 but the NYCDOF thinks otherwise and keeps charging me for an overdue sum that shouldn&amp;#39;t exist. All attempts to correspond with them has disappeared into a black hole and they&amp;#39;re starting to charge interest. What options are left aside from getting a lawyer involved?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am intending to start up a small business (think etsy shop) and I have an idea for a product I would like to make and sell that I\u2019ve never seen before, but the idea involves hair dye. I\u2019ve done as much looking as I can for any other way but putting branded hair dye like Arctic Fox or Manic Panic in it, but the pigments and processes used to make the hair dyes just aren\u2019t accessible to me. I\u2019m 19 years old and barely make enough to pay rent, so there\u2019s nothing I can really do to actually try to take my idea anywhere other than to etsy. So, if my product is not just straight up hair dye and the hair dye is just an ingredient, is it legal to use arctic fox or manic panic? If not, is there anything else I can do?",

I currently have a warrant for failing to report. \nI\u2019m not trying to get her to take the charge because I think I will get off Scott free. I\u2019m aware my actions after the initial charge are my own fault. But I did what I did in the first place for her and her life... \n she\u2019s since lost her child and is on hard drugs. Me and my family have done everything in our power to get her to get clean and try and get her life together. I\u2019m not sure she could get her kid back but she could have had more freedom with her. I just don\u2019t want to have a felony for the rest of my life for no reason.... it\u2019s taken a lot for me to want to take this action. I was aware what I was doing when I did it, but I know she shows no signs of getting better and has burned anyone trying to help her. \nEveryone deserves a second chance but she\u2019s been given multiple.... I just feel like I\u2019m giving her more than I should. I want a life like truly and it would appear she doesn\u2019t.... I feel like a trash human for considering this but want to know if there\u2019s anything I can do. My father already says he\u2019s support me and I\u2019m sure my mom and other sister would testify as well...\n Would the court even care? Is there even anything I could legally do?

My husband and I have been together for 8 years.  He has been accusing me of being in opposition of him in every way.  If I ask questions to him that he deems unnecessary he yells at the top of his lungs at me the most spiteful things.  When I was pregnant with our little boy, I said something about my doctor's  appointment he didnt like and he told me he that i could do whatever I wanted with the baby and that it was my problem now.  I pleaded for him and he stayed, why?  I have no clue, even now I don't understand why I still love him and want to make it work, but I started seeing a counselor for that issue.  He does things that make me concerned for the safety of our little boy (1.5yr).  The food he chooses to feed him is pretty unconventional and I worry about him getting sick.  There are inappropriate comments that are completely misogynistic and I don't want him to grow up thinking it's ok to treat women in this way.  Now my husband has been threating divorce again for 4 months.  The past 2 months he decided to get a girlfriend because I didn't give him sex.  He has yet to file the paperwork and said that he is already decided on divorce so the paperwork doesnt matter.  \nSo backstory behind, going on to legalities.  We are a no-fault state, so what is the likelihood that 50/50 custody will be awarded?  We have a one-party consent law am I able to record my conversations with him?  He uses my cousins spare car and they are really agitated with the treatment I have been recieving and are starting to want their car back.  They want to go get their car but he says if they do then it is being spiteful because that would make it so he can't babysit his child (he only see's him when I'm at work and if I'm home he won't come near.)  The vehicle I drive we got because both of our cars died.  The loan is in my name and he co-signed so we could build his credit. This is the reliable vehicle I use to get to work and take my child where he needs to go.  I pay the car payment and insurance and have only had to ask his help on it once.  How likely am I going to lose this as an asset?  And can my cousin go get their car or will it be seen as spiteful on my part?  I also, pay the phone bill and the payment for my husband's brand new phone.  Would it be seen as spiteful to transfer his number back to his old phone and have him give me the phone that I pay for?  Because if I cancel the line with the new phone or transfer the line to another service provider i will have to pay the remaining balance outright.  There's so much to this but putting it all would make this longer and already more identifiable then it already is.  He is vengeful and I live in a small town, so word travels fast.  I have an appointment with a lawyer but because there are not many around here my appointment is set in a few weeks and I just need to know what I am able and should do or what I should wait for my lawyer on.  Thank you for reading sorry for the long post.",

So a little back story.  My husband and I have been together for 8 years.  He has been accusing me of being in opposition of him in every way.  If I ask questions to him that he deems unnecessary he yells at the top of his lungs at me the most spiteful things.  When I was pregnant with our little boy, I said something about my doctor&amp;#39;s  appointment he didnt like and he told me he that i could do whatever I wanted with the baby and that it was my problem now.  I pleaded for him and he stayed, why?  I have no clue, even now I don&amp;#39;t understand why I still love him and want to make it work, but I started seeing a counselor for that issue.  He does things that make me concerned for the safety of our little boy (1.5yr).  The food he chooses to feed him is pretty unconventional and I worry about him getting sick.  There are inappropriate comments that are completely misogynistic and I don&amp;#39;t want him to grow up thinking it&amp;#39;s ok to treat women in this way.  Now my husband has been threating divorce again for 4 months.  The past 2 months he decided to get a girlfriend because I didn&amp;#39;t give him sex.  He has yet to file the paperwork and said that he is already decided on divorce so the paperwork doesnt matter.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo backstory behind, going on to legalities.  We are a no-fault state, so what is the likelihood that 50/50 custody will be awarded?  We have a one-party consent law am I able to record my conversations with him?  He uses my cousins spare car and they are really agitated with the treatment I have been recieving and are starting to want their car back.  They want to go get their car but he says if they do then it is being spiteful because that would make it so he can&amp;#39;t babysit his child (he only see&amp;#39;s him when I&amp;#39;m at work and if I&amp;#39;m home he won&amp;#39;t come near.)  The vehicle I drive we got because both of our cars died.  The loan is in my name and he co-signed so we could build his credit. This is the reliable vehicle I use to get to work and take my child where he needs to go.  I pay the car payment and insurance and have only had to ask his help on it once.  How likely am I going to lose this as an asset?  And can my cousin go get their car or will it be seen as spiteful on my part?  I also, pay the phone bill and the payment for my husband&amp;#39;s brand new phone.  Would it be seen as spiteful to transfer his number back to his old phone and have him give me the phone that I pay for?  Because if I cancel the line with the new phone or transfer the line to another service provider i will have to pay the remaining balance outright.  There&amp;#39;s so much to this but putting it all would make this longer and already more identifiable then it already is.  He is vengeful and I live in a small town, so word travels fast.  I have an appointment with a lawyer but because there are not many around here my appointment is set in a few weeks and I just need to know what I am able and should do or what I should wait for my lawyer on.  Thank you for reading sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "This is in Michigan. Little back story I have a 7 year old Boston terrier. my neighbors have 3 dogs a small Chihuahua and two female pitbulls. One female pitbull is dangerous and vicious. I have been told 2nd hand They use these dogs to breed.\n\nBoth of the pitbulls are leashed in a fenced in yard with gravel for extended periods of time. the fence is maybe 4 feet tall and wraps around the back 3/4 of the house on three sides. Both pitbulls are a nuisance. Barking at nothing all day long, early hours, in the morning basically whenever they are outside of the house barking. I have never seen the owners walk any of the dogs. To my knowledge 1 or both of the pitbulls spend the rest of their time in a back porch area in kennels.\n\nOne day my mother was taking my dog for a walk and the vicious dog got under the other side of the fence that faces the road on the corner. The dog attacked my dog. Animal control or dispatch was not informed of the situation, I was at work and was not aware until after the fact. Mistakes happen accidents happen my dog is okay and only suffered a small puncture on the top side of his neck. My mother did not handle the situation to my liking and was in shock and didn't know what to do. That's in the past.\n\nSince this occured about a month or two ago the danger dog has been jumping over the adjoining fence and entering our backyard, still on a leash with a collar no harness. This has happened on several occasions. This happened Thursday, and  today, Sunday. \n\nOn Thursday I told the occupant of the house at the time that the dog was over the fence and the next time it occurred I would be calling animal control. She said she was not the owner and that I needed to watch my tone and stop arguing, I simply said I'm not arguing with her and that I was telling her what was going to happen. \n\nSunday today when it happened again I took photos of the dog over the fence and called dispatch today. Did not inform neighbor before calling dispatch. The neighbor got the dog back over the fence and inside before a cop showed up. The cop came out and talked with me and told me to file a complaint with animal control. Cop Spoke with the person occupying or watching over the dogs while the neighbors are on vacation. \n\nBasically the conversation was the cop told the woman that the dog can't come over the fence Because obviously I have a dog and I'm worried not only about my dog but myself as well. She kept trying to obfuscate and telling the officer I'm not acting neighborly and that I need to talk to the owner. I was trying to explain that regardless of ownership she was charged with looking after the animals and responsible for their actions. Which was met with 'your an asshole' and 'shut up'. \n\n When the cop was leaving I gave her a look like 'you see why I had to call you right?' which I was met with the same kind of eye roll look like yeah I can see why you called. The cop told me to make a complaint with animal control so they can document it.\n\nThe neighbors rent the house. Currently their are 4 dogs occupying the house. The three that are normally there and a 4th the woman who is watching the house has brought over(presumptive). Which to my knowledge in the city is illegal. \n\nThe nuisance is real! but is that a route to remove the dog/dogs? Should I document the constant barking?\n\nWill I be held responsible for property damage if I accidentally leave dangerous materials near the adjoining fence on my property? (Joke?) \n\nWill I have grounds to destroy the dog If I knowingly let the dog hurt me while on a leash but on my property? Oops got too close.\n\nThere could be neglect but I don't want to assume just off dogs being caged.\n\nI'm to my limit with the dogs. \nI plan to file a complaint tomorrow, Monday when animal control is open. I want to be able to enjoy my backyard without constant barking and fear for my dog or my safety. Any advice is appreciated.",

Over the course of a year he told me that he would get the separation agreement from sept-dec 2019 and got one copy to me that had nothing that my ex and I agreed to split, and only had the county\u2019s that we were getting divorced in. I asked that he redo this a dozen times and never got the separation agreement. In Jan 2020, we discussed that the best route would be to file for absolute divorce and that he would write up the paperwork. This didn\u2019t happen and I called his office every week for months until I got something that lacked 75% of the information that needed to be on this form. I called back and for a few more months he said he would get it to me by the end of the week\u2026 this either never came or was filled with mistakes and missed information that he didn\u2019t put in. Over and over this happened for months. I finally scheduled a meeting that he had to miss, and finally got a face to face and made sure everything was put in. He called my ex\u2019s lawyer to discuss what we were doing and she never heard from him before that point after he told me that he would be reaching out to her multiple times. When we first met I gave him bank statements and spreadsheets showing missed payments and such by my ex, yet this seemed to be the first time he actually looked at it. There has been intense misconduct and neglect during this already stressful process making it feel like I\u2019ve been misrepresented. He said that I\u2019ve already gone over my retainer/trust for his payments when I\u2019ve got nothing but wrong paperwork and countless missed dates. I will be reporting him to the state bar but I can\u2019t afford another attorney yet. Im looking for advice on what to do and how to right this wrong.",

He told me that this would be an easy and would come in under budget and wouldn\u2019t take too long. Over the course of a year he told me that he would get the separation agreement from sept-dec 2019 and got one copy to me that had nothing that my ex and I agreed to split, and only had the county\u2019s that we were getting divorced in. I asked that he redo this a dozen times and never got the separation agreement. In Jan 2020, we discussed that the best route would be to file for absolute divorce and that he would write up the paperwork. This didn\u2019t happen and I called his office every week for months until I got something that lacked 75% of the information that needed to be on this form. I called back and for a few more months he said he would get it to me by the end of the week\u2026 this either never came or was filled with mistakes and missed information that he didn\u2019t put in. Over and over this happened for months. I finally scheduled a meeting that he had to miss, and finally got a face to face and made sure everything was put in. He called my ex\u2019s lawyer to discuss what we were doing and she never heard from him before that point after he told me that he would be reaching out to her multiple times. When we first met I gave him bank statements and spreadsheets showing missed payments and such by my ex, yet this seemed to be the first time he actually looked at it. There has been intense misconduct and neglect during this already stressful process making it feel like I\u2019ve been misrepresented. He said that I\u2019ve already gone over my retainer/trust for his payments when I\u2019ve got nothing but wrong paperwork and countless missed dates. I will be reporting him to the state bar but I can\u2019t afford another attorney yet. Im looking for advice on what to do and how to right this wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I talked to my mom about maybe seeing what can be done on the mall\u2019s part and she thinks that because we were walking on the grass and not the sidewalk we don\u2019t have a case. I also live in TX and somewhat understand how hard it is to sue here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;do I have a case or should I leave it be? I dont want anything crazy, but I would like enough to cover my medical bills seeing as I have to have an MRI, x-rays, physical therapy, and who knows what else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They offered the larger bedroom as long as I agreed to extend my lease by a few months. All the terms in the new lease stayed the same (of course, with the lease expiring a year from the date I switched bedrooms), so I signed and sent it back to them.\n\nA little over a week ago, the landlord hand-delivered a notice for all the tenants stating the rent will increase due to \"the mortgage, mortgage insurance, property taxes, educational taxes, rental insurance, home warranty, gas, electric, ROA, HOA, 'high speed' internet, rented/modem fees, admin fees, rental licenses fees, etc.\" In our city, tenants must be given at least 60 days before the first day of the rental period when the increase starts, but the landlord wants it to go into effect less than 3 weeks from now.\n\nAfter re-assessing my lease, I emailed them and reminded them that it is not stated anywhere in our most current lease agreement that they may increase the rent within the year-long period we agreed to. And if they wanted to increase the rent, they cannot expect it so soon. They responded by restating everything mentioned in the notice and that they \"do not mind letting people go\" if they cannot pay the increase.\n\nI'm sure none of this is legal in any way, but can they do this? According to our tenant rights, it does not look like they can. What steps should I take next if they plan to retaliate? (also, I do have all of our conversations documented)",

Originally, we agreed to a year-long lease but soon after I moved in, another tenant moved out. They offered the larger bedroom as long as I agreed to extend my lease by a few months. All the terms in the new lease stayed the same (of course, with the lease expiring a year from the date I switched bedrooms), so I signed and sent it back to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago, the landlord hand-delivered a notice for all the tenants stating the rent will increase due to &amp;quot;the mortgage, mortgage insurance, property taxes, educational taxes, rental insurance, home warranty, gas, electric, ROA, HOA, &amp;#39;high speed&amp;#39; internet, rented/modem fees, admin fees, rental licenses fees, etc.&amp;quot; In our city, tenants must be given at least 60 days before the first day of the rental period when the increase starts, but the landlord wants it to go into effect less than 3 weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After re-assessing my lease, I emailed them and reminded them that it is not stated anywhere in our most current lease agreement that they may increase the rent within the year-long period we agreed to. And if they wanted to increase the rent, they cannot expect it so soon. They responded by restating everything mentioned in the notice and that they &amp;quot;do not mind letting people go&amp;quot; if they cannot pay the increase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure none of this is legal in any way, but can they do this? According to our tenant rights, it does not look like they can. What steps should I take next if they plan to retaliate? (also, I do have all of our conversations documented)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
