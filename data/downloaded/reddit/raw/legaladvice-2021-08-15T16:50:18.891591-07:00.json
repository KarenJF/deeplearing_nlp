Excerpt below. \n\n\\----------------------------\n\nI never thought I'd be posting here.  \n\nIn Dallas, Texas.\n\nMy 17 y/o son was with three other boys buying snacks at Walmart Friday night at 11p, and when leaving, they saw a lot of people gathered around cars on an adjacent side street.\n\nThey went to check it out, and 5 minutes later, 20 police cars descended, and they were all arrested.  Some were arrested for street racing, some for spectating.\n\nMy son never saw any racing, he didn't even know they were racing, they were only there briefly.  They thought it was a car rally.  \n\n50+ people in all were arrested, all of the cars towed.  Many ran, many drove off, police pursuits ensued.  Some high speed pursuits went as far as 20 miles.  My son and his friends did not run, they were cooperative, as they didn't think they were doing anything wrong.\n\nMy son was held in the Marshall's holding cell until 6p the next afternoon waiting to be arraigned, eventually they released everyone with an automatic \"not guilty\" plea because the process was too slow. \n\nThe pre-trial is scheduled later next week, which also happens to be the second day of school, which is awful.  \n\nWe do plan to hire a lawyer that an attorney friend referred us to.  My son will plead not guilty.  He's a clean-cut kid, gets good grades, has literally never been in trouble (no tickets, etc.), and is in the process of applying for college.  He's already submitted two applications, those applications did ask if he's been arrested before (can't remember the exact question/wording, maybe it was \"convicted?\"..  we never expected this topic be an issue, so you don't pay attention to the wording).  He still has three more colleges that he *will* apply to and we don't know how to handle that question.\n\nWhat can/should we expect at the arraignment Wednesday, and trial?  \n\nThe law specifies, \"*knowingly*\".   My son genuinely did not know it was racing or \"a reckless driving event\", he thought it was a car rally or show like Cars and Coffee.  What are the chances that the state prosecutor or judge will have compassion for good kids on the right track, but were in the wrong place at the wrong time?  Or will they *\"nope, next\",* and convict him just because he was there? \n\nIs there anything we can do about the college application questions?\n\n    SEC. 28-204.

Apologies in advance, this will be a long one. \n\nIn the early hours of August 10th I was sexually assaulted by a security guard while at work. I am a F(34) exterminator and work the night shift mostly servicing hospitals in our area. The particular hospital that this happened at I service all of their kitchens in multiple buildings. I need a security guard to let me into a lot of the areas that I need to go to. The security guards and I have known each other for over a year and I see them at least twice a month. So over this time we have all created a relatively good working relationship. (Disclaimer: I am not an assertive person in these situations. My instinct, unfortunately, is to curl in a ball when scared and close my eyes. It's super dumb and I am working on it. Please don't make me feel even more like shit b/c of it. Also, I believe that I have never done anything to make this individual think that I wanted to have anything to do with him in a sexual way.) While servicing the first kitchen that I needed an escort for, he pinned me against a commercial dishwashing unit twice making a comment along the lines of how he could just get me from behind. After hiding under the tray return he backed off and I figured he got the point to please not do that. He pinned me again in an elevator on the way to the next kitchen. All my dumbass could do is clam up and squeeze my eyes shut and whimper. He backs off again. I needed him to open the kitchen and office in the psych hospital and while in the office he pins me on the floor and puts his face in my crotch. I push his head away and scurry to a chair in a corner. I just want to finish this account and go home. He then unlocks the kitchen and while spraying underneath that dishwashing unit he grabs my hair in a domineering way so at this point I sprayed him with my sprayer. That freaks him out and he tells me that's he's \"proud of me\". As though all of this was a perverse self defense course. I go to my work truck and he follows in suite. I knew I could defend myself better there and I wanted him to sign my paperwork. Usually we can just take a photo of something distinct in place of a signature but I wanted him to sign it. I get home and was still in shock. I got my kids to school, my husband left for work then while I was alone it all kind of hit at once. I was pursuaded by a friend to report it. My manager contacted the hospital and he was suspended pending investigation. \n\nNow here is the really sucky thing; The hospital only has camera footage of us walking in the halls. Everything that happened in the kitchens and elevator either can't be found or they do not have functional cameras in these areas. It has now turned into a \"he said, she said\" situation. I know he lives in the same city as I do. I can't go to the grocery store without freaking out and I no longer feel safe anywhere, including my home. \n\nWhat legally can I do at this point? I filed a police report but they said it would probably be weeks before I would hear anything back from an investigator. Do I sue the hospital for negligence and the security company? Can I do anything against the individual? I don't want to take any action against my company. They have been extremely supportive throughout this entire process and have taken me off nights and are giving me time to get this sorted out. I have reached out to lawyer's in the Nashville area but haven't found anyone yet to take the case. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

He is over 20K behind and I literally have to beg him to pay me.  He was also supposed to either refinance or sell our home by June of 2018 and has not done it. He claims that he can not get a mortgage due to his work history (he is a union electrician and switches jobs frequently)  and he does not want to sell it. I was a SAHM for most of our marriage and have been living check to check since the divorce. I need to take him back to court but I have nothing in savings so I'm not sure what to do.

Because we were married for 22 years he owes me $150 per week maintenance indefinitely. He is over 20K behind and I literally have to beg him to pay me.  He was also supposed to either refinance or sell our home by June of 2018 and has not done it. He claims that he can not get a mortgage due to his work history (he is a union electrician and switches jobs frequently)  and he does not want to sell it. I was a SAHM for most of our marriage and have been living check to check since the divorce. I need to take him back to court but I have nothing in savings so I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do. Any advice on how to move forward and recoup what he owes me would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I live in Illinois&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the advice everyone\u2026much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Is this legal to interfere/ tamper with tenants packages like this? Is he allowed to not allow OUR mail to be delivered to the place where we live? Is what he\u2019s doing legal in the state of New York? \n\nAlso, all packages have been virtually signed for as well so no signature was required of the door man- if that matters at all.

The super does not want to have a bunch of large packages in the lobby which I understand to some extent but nothing we\u2019ve tried to have delivered is particularly big (a three pound bag of cat food and a small bedside table lamp were both rejected)\u2026 it\u2019s not like it was furniture so I don\u2019t know why he thinks it\u2019s too large to sit next to the doorman\u2019s desk. (It\u2019s also strange that he\u2019s fine with certain packages staying by the desk but not others of the same size).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s super frustrating to have someone rejecting packages that we paid to have delivered to us. Is this legal to interfere/ tamper with tenants packages like this? Is he allowed to not allow OUR mail to be delivered to the place where we live? Is what he\u2019s doing legal in the state of New York? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, all packages have been virtually signed for as well so no signature was required of the door man- if that matters at all. Also, the door man checks your ID before you can take the package so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s worried about theft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She tires very quickly. She is very forgetful and not aware of her surroundings. She will drop her keys while walking without realizing she dropped it. Even not hearing the keys drop.\n\nShe is having a hard time realizing anything. She called my dad in a panic once asking him whether it was day time or night time. She doesn't remember dates or misremembers them. Any story she tells you, you can't believe as she most likely won't remember what actually happened.\n\nHere is where my concern for her started to grow. She has no idea what is happening with her money. She gets $2100 from the government a month and claims her bills are only $1700 a month. But she has no savings. She is $17k in debt and she literally went to go buy a fridge and stove with no money. \n\nShe claimed to us that a store worker paid the $250 deposit for the appliances. And she was planning to go to the store and pay that worker directly for the amount. We looked at her recipe and the credit card listed on the receipt doesn't match any credit card she currently had in her purse. \n\nWe literally have no idea how it was paid. Tried calling the store to see if they opened up a line of credit for her in this case but we got nowhere with that. \n\nThankfully my father went with her to the store and went to the cashier to pay the balance as I can only imagine what would have happened to her if she gave cash to some random person. \n\nHer $17k in debt is apparently is her using her credit card to pay her mortgage payments. But again she should be getting more than enough to cover the payments without putting it on her credit card.\n\nShe is not being receptive to allowing us to help her with her finances. She thinks she is fine. \n\nI'm concerned about her being taken advantage of and possibly losing so much money that she ends up homeless. She has no husband and no children. She has no one to help her day to day. \n\nWhat can we do based on New Jersey law? Who has responsibility here? What if she isn't willing to voluntarily submit? \n\nMy other concern is that she lives with my grandmother. She basically is in charge of managing both their finances. My grandmother is in better shape but she has never taken cared of her money her entire life so she isn't quite capable of handling things either. Very old school.\n\nAny advice would be great for me and my dad.",

She tires very quickly. She is very forgetful and not aware of her surroundings. She will drop her keys while walking without realizing she dropped it. Even not hearing the keys drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is having a hard time realizing anything. She called my dad in a panic once asking him whether it was day time or night time. She doesn&amp;#39;t remember dates or misremembers them. Any story she tells you, you can&amp;#39;t believe as she most likely won&amp;#39;t remember what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where my concern for her started to grow. She has no idea what is happening with her money. She gets $2100 from the government a month and claims her bills are only $1700 a month. But she has no savings. She is $17k in debt and she literally went to go buy a fridge and stove with no money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She claimed to us that a store worker paid the $250 deposit for the appliances. And she was planning to go to the store and pay that worker directly for the amount. We looked at her recipe and the credit card listed on the receipt doesn&amp;#39;t match any credit card she currently had in her purse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We literally have no idea how it was paid. Tried calling the store to see if they opened up a line of credit for her in this case but we got nowhere with that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully my father went with her to the store and went to the cashier to pay the balance as I can only imagine what would have happened to her if she gave cash to some random person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her $17k in debt is apparently is her using her credit card to pay her mortgage payments. But again she should be getting more than enough to cover the payments without putting it on her credit card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is not being receptive to allowing us to help her with her finances. She thinks she is fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m concerned about her being taken advantage of and possibly losing so much money that she ends up homeless. She has no husband and no children. She has no one to help her day to day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can we do based on New Jersey law? Who has responsibility here? What if she isn&amp;#39;t willing to voluntarily submit? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other concern is that she lives with my grandmother. She basically is in charge of managing both their finances. My grandmother is in better shape but she has never taken cared of her money her entire life so she isn&amp;#39;t quite capable of handling things either. Very old school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be great for me and my dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My DIL has a 2 unit apartment and neither of the renters have been paying rent.  One is a great family that tried as hard as they could and made their payments up until about September.  The other unit has a tenant that is, to put it mildly, difficult.  She&amp;#39;s on disability and retirement so it isn&amp;#39;t a matter of her losing her job, she just found out she could live rent free if she decided to just quit paying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of the leases expired in January so there is no lease currently in place.  My DIL just found out from the nice tenant that the difficult one is renting out the apartment as an Air B&amp;amp;B when she goes out of town to visit family so she&amp;#39;s still technically living there but for very short periods of time throughout the month.  The lease specifically states that subletting or subleasing is verboten but she keeps playing the no eviction card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that a lot of people are rooting for renters and in a lot of cases, not paying just sticks it to the man.  Unfortunately in this case, they are just a couple that used to live in one of the apartments and when their family grew, they bought another house and rented the second apartment.  Now they are stuck making a payment on a house that 2 people are living in for free and they are at the end of their financial rope.  There&amp;#39;s isn&amp;#39;t a foreclosure forbearance for landlords that can&amp;#39;t collect rent but still have to pay their mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are also trying to sell the place but the difficult tenant refuses to let the real estate agent show the property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not being able to evict people does actually hurt landlords too.  Yes, there&amp;#39;s a reimbursement program in place but with 6 million tenants eligible, they&amp;#39;ve only sent out about 5 thousand checks so there&amp;#39;s a real risk they may lose the house before they can collect a check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything they can do at this point to get the bad tenant out due to the violation of the lease or due to the fact that there&amp;#39;s no lease in place?  She&amp;#39;s actually making money with the property while stiffing the owners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure the hive mind can help so thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

All of their efforts started in 2018, 12 years after I had been established.\n\nKinda pissed me off but I learned that I can't stop him from using my company name because I only registered as a sole prop with a DBA at the county level.\n\nThe \"offending\" company is now threatening to take over my domain name by paying ICANN to open a case. I believe he is doing this to lowball me into selling it to him for $10. After threatening me with an ICANN takedown, he started his offer to buy the domain name from me at $10.\n\nDoes my DBA and proof of business via the website being online for 15 years prevent them from taking it over via ICANN dispute process?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nF",

Completely the city's fault and the bus driver admitted to it (plus, the busses here in Oakland have cameras).  \n\nUnfortunately my girlfriend and I were not in great shape to begin with - we both suffer from ongoing spinal issues and this kind of exacerbated  it.  We're not the type to seek any kind of damages and do not want to make anyone \"pay\". Of course, my car is completely totaled as the bus basically ran over the front/left side of my car and damaged my axel and ball bearings and I think the insurance or the city will cover that part of it.  \n\nWe're trying to decide how to proceed, and are considering writing a letter to the city of Oakland, at least requesting that they cover our physical therapy, but I'm not really sure if I want to go that route. I'm thinking it might be nice if they cover my deductible to see our doctors, which is only probably $50 - so not sure if this is even worth it. Has anyone been in a similar situation?",

                    "selftext": "South Dakota. My dad owned the same house for over 40 years. He owned it before he married my mom and she inherited it when he died. A few years after he died, she decided to move to where my sister lives and put the house up for sale.\n\nGuy suing (calling him A-hole1) is a complete psychopath who has lived in the neighborhood 20+ years and everyone hates him. There are a thousand things we could talk about with him but the important bits are he\u2019s a lawyer (not actually practicing) and a doctor (who lost privileges at the local hospital for being a psychotic asshole but not his license somehow and is still in private practice). So, he\u2019s got a shitload of money and knows the law and also has bought up pretty much every other lawyer in town.\n\nHe\u2019s also been methodically buying up every property he can in my mom\u2019s neighborhood and turning them into rentals, subdividing lots and building more rentals, and basically doing his best to take over and ruin what was some very premium real estate right next to a national park.\n\nWhen my mom\u2019s house went up for sale, he immediately showed up on her doorstep (literally a couple of hours after it posted), and offered her her asking price in cash. She told him she\u2019d think about it, because it freaked her out and she didn\u2019t know quite what to do, and she said he was visibly pissed when he left. \n\nMy mom isn\u2019t stupid, but she has never bought or sold a property in her entire life, so she relied heavily on her realtor. The realtor told her she could definitely wait on A-hole1\u2019s offer and see if anyone else wanted to go higher. She then got a higher offer and took it\u2014but, rather mysteriously, that offer fell through under some weird circumstances and my mom didn\u2019t have a buyer anymore. She had closed on her new house already, so she was even more freaked out and wanted to hurry up and sell even though my sister and I told her to calm down and wait.\n\nShe then got an offer from a guy who\u2019s a lawyer and on the city council (A-hole2). It was for more than her asking price, and *he waived an inspection and a survey* and just bought the place. So my mom took it and moved.\n\nNow, the trouble comes from a detached garage my dad had built. He owned several acres so there were lots of spots to build this thing, but he decided to put it off the end of the driveway. He had a professional contractor come build it, and while my mom had almost no input, she says a survey was done it make sure it was far enough from the neighbors\u2019 property to be okay. \n\nThe properties have no distinct borders; it\u2019s just a big meadow, no fence line or obvious markers. Also the neighbors are life-long friends of my parents so if there had been an issue it would have probably been easy to solve. Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it\u2019s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it\u2019s not encroaching on anything, and we don\u2019t have to cross the property line to access it). \n\nBut my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad\u2019s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it\u2019s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nAnyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. *He\u2019d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.*\n\nA-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she\u2019d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he\u2019d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that\u2019s why A-hole2 hadn\u2019t done the survey.\n\nShe got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1\u2019s lawyer that they knew she hadn\u2019t been dishonest and they just hoped she\u2019d \u201cpitch in\u201d to move the garage like she\u2019d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).\n\nSo, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again. \n\nMy mom got a summons served to her new house; again she\u2019s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can\u2019t control and that\u2019s another topic) so she doesn\u2019t ever just open the door. \n\nShe saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn\u2019t; she told the person she didn\u2019t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.\n\nMy mom\u2019s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (*coincidentally*\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he\u2019s bought every firm on this side.\n\nSo\u2026 my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer. \n\nHow worried should she be? How can I help her?",

Last year my fianc\u00e9 and I bought a tent for our older girls, and we left it up in the back of our property all summer. (We have 2 houses and an out building, so it was out of view from the main house). It had stuff zipped up in it, and survived lots of storms. One night, after I hadn\u2019t been back in the back property for a while, I noticed that the tent was gone, and the stuff that was zipped up inside of it was laying on the ground next to where it has been. Obviously it has been stolen, but I had absolutely no details. There was no one seen, I don\u2019t even know when exactly it happened. So I chalked it up to make sure my stuff is secured on my property and haven\u2019t thought much about it since. \n\nFast forward to today, and a small clearing right where the woods start in the back of my property, there was an empty alcohol bottle back there that hadn\u2019t been there when I mowed last week. It\u2019s FAR from the road, and at the back of the woods is a large river that you can\u2019t really cross. Also, the field \u201cinlet\u201d is so far back, there\u2019s no possible way it would be someone \u201cjust passing through\u201d.\n\nIt scares me that there could be someone (or people?) hanging out in my woods. My girls used to go back and play in the field and the woods together, but after seeing that bottle I\u2019m terrified of there being someone out there. I don\u2019t want to feel unsafe on my own property, and I definitely want my children safe. If I haven\u2019t actually *SEEN* anyone, what can I possibly do? \n\nTL;DR: Found evidence of trespassers on large property, but haven\u2019t seen anyone. What can I do?",

Last year my fianc\u00e9 and I bought a tent for our older girls, and we left it up in the back of our property all summer. (We have 2 houses and an out building, so it was out of view from the main house). It had stuff zipped up in it, and survived lots of storms. One night, after I hadn\u2019t been back in the back property for a while, I noticed that the tent was gone, and the stuff that was zipped up inside of it was laying on the ground next to where it has been. Obviously it has been stolen, but I had absolutely no details. There was no one seen, I don\u2019t even know when exactly it happened. So I chalked it up to make sure my stuff is secured on my property and haven\u2019t thought much about it since. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and a small clearing right where the woods start in the back of my property, there was an empty alcohol bottle back there that hadn\u2019t been there when I mowed last week. It\u2019s FAR from the road, and at the back of the woods is a large river that you can\u2019t really cross. Also, the field \u201cinlet\u201d is so far back, there\u2019s no possible way it would be someone \u201cjust passing through\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It scares me that there could be someone (or people?) hanging out in my woods. My girls used to go back and play in the field and the woods together, but after seeing that bottle I\u2019m terrified of there being someone out there. I don\u2019t want to feel unsafe on my own property, and I definitely want my children safe. If I haven\u2019t actually &lt;em&gt;SEEN&lt;/em&gt; anyone, what can I possibly do? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Found evidence of trespassers on large property, but haven\u2019t seen anyone. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I finally got three calls from them today; two were voicemails asking me to call back to schedule the appointment and a third was clearly unintended. What I heard was a two and a half minute conversation of a group of secretaries basically making fun of my medical history. It was, more or less: \n\"Is that (me) calling back? I just called him. He has a referral for urology and they were making him wait while they verified his financial information so you know, it's his fault anyway (laughter and agreement from three others). Yeeeaaaah it's his fault. He can't walk, he can barely function. Oh well. I mean I guess it is our fault because we didn't contact him earlier. (Someone in the back says 'yeeaaaah that's our fault'). Let's see here... (Name of old hospital) ... Behavioral health, ooooh suicidal? SHI? What's that stand for... I know the S is suicide... \n(Someone in the back: self harm initiative?) \n... No suicide... Homicide? Suicide homicidal? (Someone in the back: \"I really don't think that stands for homicidal...\") \nWell you never know, I mean he could be homicidal too! (more laughter from three others). This was for (name of old hospital) behavioral health... Probably homicidal.\" And then they must have realized they were leaving a message. They hung up. End of message. The long and short of why I'm here is that what they were referencing was a horrible point in my life wherein I checked myself into a psych ward worried about my mental health, that was about seven years ago. I've never been homicidal in my entire life. These humans were joking about a mental health crisis a mentally ill patient had over half a decade ago, my financial situation, as well as a few other quips during the nearly three minute voicemail. I have no idea what to do. I feel absolutely mortified. I know I need to call and inform someone, and I did when I called back to schedule the appointment. I told the secretary about the voicemail I received from her office and she sounded equally mortified, asked me if I wanted to speak to 'her supervisor'. I declined thinking it best to get advice from anyone before talking to anyone on their end about this. The call was basically a bunch of people laughing at my expense the entire time. I feel like I can't walk into my doctor's office knowing that the secretaries  at reception feel that way about the patients they see. I'm already looking into a different primary care provider despite being, otherwise, happy with my current one. I feel like I was bullied over a voicemail about the worst point in my life by individuals in an environment meant to make patients feel welcomed and safe. I have the voicemail saved, downloaded, backed up twice. Do I just contact HR and email them the voicemail? Should I be contacting an attorney? I feel so damned lost. All day I've just been shifting from awful anger to bouts of crying. Thanks for your time, should anyone find this.",

I finally got three calls from them today; two were voicemails asking me to call back to schedule the appointment and a third was clearly unintended. What I heard was a two and a half minute conversation of a group of secretaries basically making fun of my medical history. It was, more or less: \n&amp;quot;Is that (me) calling back? I just called him. He has a referral for urology and they were making him wait while they verified his financial information so you know, it&amp;#39;s his fault anyway (laughter and agreement from three others). Yeeeaaaah it&amp;#39;s his fault. He can&amp;#39;t walk, he can barely function. Oh well. I mean I guess it is our fault because we didn&amp;#39;t contact him earlier. (Someone in the back says &amp;#39;yeeaaaah that&amp;#39;s our fault&amp;#39;). Let&amp;#39;s see here... (Name of old hospital) ... Behavioral health, ooooh suicidal? SHI? What&amp;#39;s that stand for... I know the S is suicide... \n(Someone in the back: self harm initiative?) \n... No suicide... Homicide? Suicide homicidal? (Someone in the back: &amp;quot;I really don&amp;#39;t think that stands for homicidal...&amp;quot;) \nWell you never know, I mean he could be homicidal too! (more laughter from three others). This was for (name of old hospital) behavioral health... Probably homicidal.&amp;quot; And then they must have realized they were leaving a message. They hung up. End of message. The long and short of why I&amp;#39;m here is that what they were referencing was a horrible point in my life wherein I checked myself into a psych ward worried about my mental health, that was about seven years ago. I&amp;#39;ve never been homicidal in my entire life. These humans were joking about a mental health crisis a mentally ill patient had over half a decade ago, my financial situation, as well as a few other quips during the nearly three minute voicemail. I have no idea what to do. I feel absolutely mortified. I know I need to call and inform someone, and I did when I called back to schedule the appointment. I told the secretary about the voicemail I received from her office and she sounded equally mortified, asked me if I wanted to speak to &amp;#39;her supervisor&amp;#39;. I declined thinking it best to get advice from anyone before talking to anyone on their end about this. The call was basically a bunch of people laughing at my expense the entire time. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t walk into my doctor&amp;#39;s office knowing that the secretaries  at reception feel that way about the patients they see. I&amp;#39;m already looking into a different primary care provider despite being, otherwise, happy with my current one. I feel like I was bullied over a voicemail about the worst point in my life by individuals in an environment meant to make patients feel welcomed and safe. I have the voicemail saved, downloaded, backed up twice. Do I just contact HR and email them the voicemail? Should I be contacting an attorney? I feel so damned lost. All day I&amp;#39;ve just been shifting from awful anger to bouts of crying. Thanks for your time, should anyone find this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Rent and bills will be due soon and I don\u2019t want to have my utilities shut off for nonpayment or face eviction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there any way I can get access to the account?

Neighbors all claim they have gone to check her house and there is no one there, no sign anyone but Diane has been there, she has zero signs of physical trauma, ligature marks or any of the stuff she would have if there was in fact men trying to tie her down and hold her hostage\u2026\n\nNeighbors claim she has been acting erratic and showing signs of mental decline for a little while, and I know she suffers from a host of medical issues like autoimmune disorders so I\u2019m not sure if maybe whatever is going on is related to that or she just has early onset dementia given her age, or something else. She is one of those stubborn people who would never admit to her mental faculties being diminished in any capacity and we aren\u2019t super close with her so hence why we are so out of the loop on everything.\n\nSo now we are driving out to California to see what the hell is going on because the neighbors insisted we do so, they are all very concerned and frankly it seems they\u2019re tired of having to look after her. \n\nThe legal advice I\u2019m looking for is, I have no idea what we are looking at here. I have a feeling that this might turn into a situation where we might need to basically get her committed somewhere against her will and take over her assets since she might be having some kind of episodes where she isn\u2019t always lucid, and if so then she isn\u2019t capable of caring for herself. I know most likely this would be a case of getting my boyfriend appointed as her power of attorney so he can make medical decisions for her and control her assets in case we need to hire help like a nurse to look after her or maybe even getting her checked in to some facility where she can be care for around the clock. This would preferably also be in our home state of AZ since it is admittedly much harder to look in on her from out of state\u2026\n\nI just don\u2019t really know the procedure for doing all of this when she will probably put up a fight the moment she realizes what is going on. I feel like we will probably have to essentially get an attorney and gather official testimony from the neighbors who have been helping her the past couple months. Diane is the kind of person who would be extremely offended if anyone ever questioned her sanity and she will likely be the very opposite of cooperative in all of this, so I just need to know how this will all work (from anyone who has dealt with this kind of thing personally or professionally preferably) - also I was wondering what kind of attorney would I even look for in all of this?",

Neighbors all claim they have gone to check her house and there is no one there, no sign anyone but Diane has been there, she has zero signs of physical trauma, ligature marks or any of the stuff she would have if there was in fact men trying to tie her down and hold her hostage\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neighbors claim she has been acting erratic and showing signs of mental decline for a little while, and I know she suffers from a host of medical issues like autoimmune disorders so I\u2019m not sure if maybe whatever is going on is related to that or she just has early onset dementia given her age, or something else. She is one of those stubborn people who would never admit to her mental faculties being diminished in any capacity and we aren\u2019t super close with her so hence why we are so out of the loop on everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now we are driving out to California to see what the hell is going on because the neighbors insisted we do so, they are all very concerned and frankly it seems they\u2019re tired of having to look after her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The legal advice I\u2019m looking for is, I have no idea what we are looking at here. I have a feeling that this might turn into a situation where we might need to basically get her committed somewhere against her will and take over her assets since she might be having some kind of episodes where she isn\u2019t always lucid, and if so then she isn\u2019t capable of caring for herself. I know most likely this would be a case of getting my boyfriend appointed as her power of attorney so he can make medical decisions for her and control her assets in case we need to hire help like a nurse to look after her or maybe even getting her checked in to some facility where she can be care for around the clock. This would preferably also be in our home state of AZ since it is admittedly much harder to look in on her from out of state\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don\u2019t really know the procedure for doing all of this when she will probably put up a fight the moment she realizes what is going on. I feel like we will probably have to essentially get an attorney and gather official testimony from the neighbors who have been helping her the past couple months. Diane is the kind of person who would be extremely offended if anyone ever questioned her sanity and she will likely be the very opposite of cooperative in all of this, so I just need to know how this will all work (from anyone who has dealt with this kind of thing personally or professionally preferably) - also I was wondering what kind of attorney would I even look for in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Two weeks prior to the move in date, one of our friend's (not the one in question) let's call him Jake. Jake called us up and said \"Hey guys, I'm bailing on the lease, my mom doesn't want me to move in with yall\" Kinda ticked off about that, we moved on and found a replacement for him. Jake agreed to pay the initial utility deposit for getting everything turned on. Trevor was pissed and said \"Yeah, he better pay the utility deposit, he already signed the lease.\" We had to sign an updated lease for the replacement roommate the day of move in. Trevor signed the lease, and called us about 3 hours later and said \"Yeah, I'm gonna bail on the lease as well\" THE DAY OF MOVE IN. Trevor is now ignoring me when I ask for the utility deposit money that he still owes me, because in his words \"He already signed the lease\"\n\nPrior to all of this, I agreed to rent out a storage unit for the four of us to put our stuff in for two weeks, (tl;dr our other apartment lease ended on the 31st, new one didn't start till the 13th) I'm currently torn as to what I should do, as not getting this utility deposit from him will cause a serious money issue on our end, as we'd have to split his deposit 3 ways. Which is just unfair for all of us. I have been considering changing the padlock on the storage unit, and keeping his stuff hostage until I receive Trevor's utility payment. Am I legally allowed to do this? (The storage unit is in my name) and what other course of action could I take here? I've spoken to him in person and asked for it and he just says \"Yeah I'll send it later\" and never does. I've tried being civil with him, but It's gotten to the point that he's just blatantly disrespecting me, and I don't think words by themselves will solve this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: There is no written agreement stating that he needs to pay me for the utilities.\n\nEdit: This is in Texas",
