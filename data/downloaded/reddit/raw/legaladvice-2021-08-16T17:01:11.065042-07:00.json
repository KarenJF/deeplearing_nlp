After giving them my social literally zero information pops up about me and I have no credit even though when I look up my old number its in the low 700's. Im basically at my Witts end trying to fix all of this up. When I call social security they don't believe its me and when I sent over all of the information and documents I had to the 3 credit bureaus they still were not able to update the credit history to my new number.\n\nWhat can I do about this? I would like to obtain a lawyer because I would like them to take me seriously. I also would like to try and go after whoever is responsible because all of this has impacted my life quite substantially (stuck living with my parents, getting passport, applying for a mortgage, or literally anything else that requires a credit check).

I failed an entire grade, and had to go to alternative school to make up those missing credits. Brother dropped out in high school but got his GED. My little sister also dropped out but is currently working on her GED. I am the only one who has my high school diploma. This happened after CPS took all four of us and placed us in foster homes. We were sent back to school. Mother regained custody under the condition that she puts us all back in public school. So now 7 years later she wants to home school my youngest brother who should be starting kindergarten. I argued and told her he needs a real education in public school. She said I had no say in what she does with him. I\u2019m wondering what I could do, or who I could talk to, to make sure that my brother starts school this year.

                    "selftext": "South Dakota. My dad owned the same house for over 40 years. He owned it before he married my mom and she inherited it when he died. A few years after he died, she decided to move to where my sister lives and put the house up for sale.\n\nGuy suing (calling him A-hole1) is a complete psychopath who has lived in the neighborhood 20+ years and everyone hates him. There are a thousand things we could talk about with him but the important bits are he\u2019s a lawyer (not actually practicing) and a doctor (who lost privileges at the local hospital for being a psychotic asshole but not his license somehow and is still in private practice). So, he\u2019s got a shitload of money and knows the law and also has bought up pretty much every other lawyer in town.\n\nHe\u2019s also been methodically buying up every property he can in my mom\u2019s neighborhood and turning them into rentals, subdividing lots and building more rentals, and basically doing his best to take over and ruin what was some very premium real estate right next to a national park.\n\nWhen my mom\u2019s house went up for sale, he immediately showed up on her doorstep (literally a couple of hours after it posted), and offered her her asking price in cash. She told him she\u2019d think about it, because it freaked her out and she didn\u2019t know quite what to do, and she said he was visibly pissed when he left. \n\nMy mom isn\u2019t stupid, but she has never bought or sold a property in her entire life, so she relied heavily on her realtor. The realtor told her she could definitely wait on A-hole1\u2019s offer and see if anyone else wanted to go higher. She then got a higher offer and took it\u2014but, rather mysteriously, that offer fell through under some weird circumstances and my mom didn\u2019t have a buyer anymore. She had closed on her new house already, so she was even more freaked out and wanted to hurry up and sell even though my sister and I told her to calm down and wait.\n\nShe then got an offer from a guy who\u2019s a lawyer and on the city council (A-hole2). It was for more than her asking price, and *he waived an inspection and a survey* and just bought the place. So my mom took it and moved.\n\nNow, the trouble comes from a detached garage my dad had built. He owned several acres so there were lots of spots to build this thing, but he decided to put it off the end of the driveway. He had a professional contractor come build it, and while my mom had almost no input, she says a survey was done it make sure it was far enough from the neighbors\u2019 property to be okay. \n\nThe properties have no distinct borders; it\u2019s just a big meadow, no fence line or obvious markers. Also the neighbors are life-long friends of my parents so if there had been an issue it would have probably been easy to solve. Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it\u2019s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it\u2019s not encroaching on anything, and we don\u2019t have to cross the property line to access it). \n\nBut my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad\u2019s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it\u2019s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nAnyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. *He\u2019d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.*\n\nA-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she\u2019d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he\u2019d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that\u2019s why A-hole2 hadn\u2019t done the survey.\n\nShe got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1\u2019s lawyer that they knew she hadn\u2019t been dishonest and they just hoped she\u2019d \u201cpitch in\u201d to move the garage like she\u2019d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).\n\nSo, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again. \n\nMy mom got a summons served to her new house; again she\u2019s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can\u2019t control and that\u2019s another topic) so she doesn\u2019t ever just open the door. \n\nShe saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn\u2019t; she told the person she didn\u2019t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.\n\nMy mom\u2019s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (*coincidentally*\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he\u2019s bought every firm on this side.\n\nSo\u2026 my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer. \n\nHow worried should she be? How can I help her?",

Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it\u2019s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it\u2019s not encroaching on anything, and we don\u2019t have to cross the property line to access it). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad\u2019s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it\u2019s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don\u2019t think so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. &lt;em&gt;He\u2019d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she\u2019d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he\u2019d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that\u2019s why A-hole2 hadn\u2019t done the survey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1\u2019s lawyer that they knew she hadn\u2019t been dishonest and they just hoped she\u2019d \u201cpitch in\u201d to move the garage like she\u2019d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom got a summons served to her new house; again she\u2019s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can\u2019t control and that\u2019s another topic) so she doesn\u2019t ever just open the door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn\u2019t; she told the person she didn\u2019t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom\u2019s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (&lt;em&gt;coincidentally&lt;/em&gt;\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he\u2019s bought every firm on this side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So\u2026 my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How worried should she be? How can I help her?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My roommates and have had our packages rejected by the doorman (at our supers request)and sent back to the sender on multiple occasions now. Basically, when a package is brought in that will not fit into our tiny mailbox, the doorman will buzz up to the apartment and if you do not answer he will SOMETIMES not allow the mail carrier to leave the package with him. (There\u2019s consistently a stack of packages next to the doorman so it\u2019s weird that he sometimes keeps packages and sometimes rejects them). The super does not want to have a bunch of large packages in the lobby which I understand to some extent but nothing we\u2019ve tried to have delivered is particularly big (a three pound bag of cat food and a small bedside table lamp were both rejected)\u2026 it\u2019s not like it was furniture so I don\u2019t know why he thinks it\u2019s too large to sit next to the doorman\u2019s desk. (It\u2019s also strange that he\u2019s fine with certain packages staying by the desk but not others of the same size).\n\nIt\u2019s super frustrating to have someone rejecting packages that we paid to have delivered to us. Is this legal to interfere/ tamper with tenants packages like this? Is he allowed to not allow OUR mail to be delivered to the place where we live? Is what he\u2019s doing legal in the state of New York? \n\nAlso, all packages have been virtually signed for as well so no signature was required of the door man- if that matters at all. Also, the door man checks your ID before you can take the package so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s worried about theft.",

My roommates and have had our packages rejected by the doorman (at our supers request)and sent back to the sender on multiple occasions now. Basically, when a package is brought in that will not fit into our tiny mailbox, the doorman will buzz up to the apartment and if you do not answer he will SOMETIMES not allow the mail carrier to leave the package with him. (There\u2019s consistently a stack of packages next to the doorman so it\u2019s weird that he sometimes keeps packages and sometimes rejects them). The super does not want to have a bunch of large packages in the lobby which I understand to some extent but nothing we\u2019ve tried to have delivered is particularly big (a three pound bag of cat food and a small bedside table lamp were both rejected)\u2026 it\u2019s not like it was furniture so I don\u2019t know why he thinks it\u2019s too large to sit next to the doorman\u2019s desk. (It\u2019s also strange that he\u2019s fine with certain packages staying by the desk but not others of the same size).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s super frustrating to have someone rejecting packages that we paid to have delivered to us. Is this legal to interfere/ tamper with tenants packages like this? Is he allowed to not allow OUR mail to be delivered to the place where we live? Is what he\u2019s doing legal in the state of New York? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, all packages have been virtually signed for as well so no signature was required of the door man- if that matters at all. Also, the door man checks your ID before you can take the package so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s worried about theft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We arrive last night around 11 pm and around 1230 am my girlfriend was changing after a shower only to see a man\u2019s hand and his cell phone right up against my window. I ran out to find the guy but no luck. There are footprints left by my window and we will be getting some cameras setup. My question is, should we file a police report just so that it\u2019s on record in case we get further video evidence in the future? We\u2019re in Nevada, idk if I have to specify-I\u2019m new here.",

The window blinds were raised up about 6 inches or less so hardly anything. If you were to look in, you\u2019d have to be squatting. My gf and I have been out of town for a week but my other roommate has been home. We arrive last night around 11 pm and around 1230 am my girlfriend was changing after a shower only to see a man\u2019s hand and his cell phone right up against my window. I ran out to find the guy but no luck. There are footprints left by my window and we will be getting some cameras setup. My question is, should we file a police report just so that it\u2019s on record in case we get further video evidence in the future? We\u2019re in Nevada, idk if I have to specify-I\u2019m new here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So we took over the schooling.\n\nWhich now brings us to the most current situation. \nNo one knows where his mother actually is right now.\n\n As far as we know she is in hiding from an abusive man she started a relationship with. Between January and July 2021, she had been to the hospital from a beating, had to be put in a medically induced coma because of swelling in the brain from said beating not too long after, had her house broken into by said boyfriend while she was in florida with her mother, had boyfriend steal her car, had boyfriend attempt to run her over but miss and hit someone else, continue to live in the house with said boyfriend still and then go on the run with boyfriend.\n\n\nShe is wanted by the police for at least questioning and if she doesnt cooperate then she will be wanted for aiding and abetting or harboring a fugitive.\n\nWe know for certain she has no car and now has no house as her mother had bought it for her and has taken it back and plans to sell. \nHer mother is on our side.\nOur son is now enrolled in school in the town we live\n\nWe would like to get full custody and remove the child support that my husband is still paying but after contacting about 10 lawyers with \"family law\" on their website, I've gotten 10 responses saying that they dont practice this specific type of law. \n\nSo what am I supposed to be looking for or what exactly do we need to do?",

It's been 8 months now of this bullshit. I just want my $2300. Now that covid is easing up, I am working more and I just don't have the time to deal with this anymore but I can't let something like this go unpunished.

I sent the landlords the order along with a demand letter explaining how we would like to receive payment and a reasonable due date. That due date has now passed and, big surprise, we don&amp;#39;t have our money. So the next step is to take them to small claims court. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my question. Look guys, I&amp;#39;m so tired of this. It&amp;#39;s been 8 months now of this bullshit. I just want my $2300. Now that covid is easing up, I am working more and I just don&amp;#39;t have the time to deal with this anymore but I can&amp;#39;t let something like this go unpunished. It requires so much reading and printing and mailing. Is there someone I can hire who is able to deal with this on my behalf? Can the cost of hiring someone be included in the claim against the landlords? Will I ever get my money from these clowns? Please help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

(A box break is  when a box of cards is divided up among collectors who purchase the  right to receive cards to that specific team).\n\nDuring  the live stream, the seller pulled an $7,000-$10,000 card for LaMelo  Ball who plays for the team I purchased. However this card was a  \"redemption card\" meaning that the player did not submit their  autographed card in time for the release of this card product so this  \"redemption card\" is for a future delivery of said card.\n\nHe  first tried scamming by sending the package to an incorrect address  with the package opened and retaped to blame the \"missing\" card on  household it was delivered. USPS and I cleared up this scheme very  quickly.  Obviously the package I received did not contain the $10k card  and only contained a single card worth less than $1.\n\nAfter  confronting him about this he admitted that he didn't send it to me the  redemption card and the reason being that since the \"redemption card\"  didn't explicitly  state \"Charlotte Hornets\" that he didn't send it to  me. I showed him  that he didn't have a \"redemption spot\" for sale or  sold during this  specific break and now he claims he sold a separate  redemption spot in a DIFFERENT auction.\n\nI have a copy of our full conversation done through eBay messaging as well as other images countering his lies if anyone is interested.\n\nI've  already filed police reports and reported this incident to eBay fraud  investigation.  I am most certainly willing to pursue any legal actions  needed to get this scumbag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny legal advice would be much appreciated.",

(A box break is  when a box of cards is divided up among collectors who purchase the  right to receive cards to that specific team).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During  the live stream, the seller pulled an $7,000-$10,000 card for LaMelo  Ball who plays for the team I purchased. However this card was a  &amp;quot;redemption card&amp;quot; meaning that the player did not submit their  autographed card in time for the release of this card product so this  &amp;quot;redemption card&amp;quot; is for a future delivery of said card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He  first tried scamming by sending the package to an incorrect address  with the package opened and retaped to blame the &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; card on  household it was delivered. USPS and I cleared up this scheme very  quickly.  Obviously the package I received did not contain the $10k card  and only contained a single card worth less than $1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After  confronting him about this he admitted that he didn&amp;#39;t send it to me the  redemption card and the reason being that since the &amp;quot;redemption card&amp;quot;  didn&amp;#39;t explicitly  state &amp;quot;Charlotte Hornets&amp;quot; that he didn&amp;#39;t send it to  me. I showed him  that he didn&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;redemption spot&amp;quot; for sale or  sold during this  specific break and now he claims he sold a separate  redemption spot in a DIFFERENT auction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a copy of our full conversation done through eBay messaging as well as other images countering his lies if anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve  already filed police reports and reported this incident to eBay fraud  investigation.  I am most certainly willing to pursue any legal actions  needed to get this scumbag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any legal advice would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He didn\u2019t provide the school with his ssn the second time around, so is that why he hasn\u2019t been caught? Should I report him?

He now has a another transcript with good grades and the new name and plans on using that to transfer. Is this illegal and will he get caught? He didn\u2019t provide the school with his ssn the second time around, so is that why he hasn\u2019t been caught? Should I report him? If he applies to another school and they ask for the transcript using the student clearinghouse wouldn\u2019t he be able to get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She would rather not have to deal with him by asking him to sign over the title because he is likely to drag his feet, or just ignore her request.  I assume there must be a way that she can avoid the possible trouble of having to deal with him at all.  Any advice? We live in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I was only provided with access to one call in three weeks of being in the program\n\n\\- Being charged much more than others for the exact same program. The pricing of the program isn\u2019t advertised anywhere. Some people were charged 1.5k while I was charged 4k\n\n\\- The course/coaching doesn't have an agreement or a sales page (intentional so he can charge what he wants)\n\nI asked him for a refund 3 weeks after signing up and he then kicked me out of the program as well as revoked access to the videos and said he'd refund me 25% or $1,000 of the $4,000. I filed a dispute with my credit card and now have to wait 10 days before they submit it.\n\nI have documented proof of everything and there are 15+ other students that feel scammed as well.\n\nHow would you go about getting a refund given he is refusing to give one? If my credit card sides in his favor, which I highly doubt they will, do we have collective recourse as a group to sue him?",

The pricing of the program isn\u2019t advertised anywhere. Some people were charged 1.5k while I was charged 4k&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The course/coaching doesn&amp;#39;t have an agreement or a sales page (intentional so he can charge what he wants)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him for a refund 3 weeks after signing up and he then kicked me out of the program as well as revoked access to the videos and said he&amp;#39;d refund me 25% or $1,000 of the $4,000. I filed a dispute with my credit card and now have to wait 10 days before they submit it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have documented proof of everything and there are 15+ other students that feel scammed as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How would you go about getting a refund given he is refusing to give one? If my credit card sides in his favor, which I highly doubt they will, do we have collective recourse as a group to sue him?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The danes are 14 mos female, 16 mos male and both intact. We have 3 small kids, and 2 other small dogs (under 20lbs). They've never been aggressive towards us adults, the kids, or small dogs.\n\nThe sitter has no dogs of her own and my husband said to be careful if they were around small dogs because they don't realize they are giants (over 100lbs). We keep our danes separate from our small dogs unless we are out supervising them because they try to play with the small dogs like they are all the same size. \n\nThe sitter apparently ended up watching 2 smaller dogs, a beagle and a coonhound, we were not told there would be other dogs there. We were told there were no other dogs in the home and she wasn't watching any other dogs. The sitter went grocery shopping and left all 4 of the dogs out together roaming in the backyard during a severe thunderstorm. We told the sitter we don't ever leave the danes to roam if we aren't home, and she had an XXL crate we provided for the danes, we crate them together as they fit and like to be together. We also told her we don't leave the dogs outside during the rain. \n\nWhen the sitter got back from grocery shopping the beagle was in the back yard disembowled and had to be euthanized. \n\nThe sitter texted me that the female dane has puncture marks on her neck that happened yesterday (we were not notified of an injury). She is claiming the injury is from my male dane.\n\nWe aren't in town and won't be home until tomorrow. Not really sure what to do. \n\nI dont know if I have any legal responsibilities since they are my dogs, I obviously did not choose the situation they were put in and don't even know what all happened. The owners of the small dog told the sitter to tell us \"they need to be careful if they have children\". Which makes me think they are thinking the danes are aggressive. \n\nBoth danes have completed CGC. The male listens well and so does the female. They can be resistant if they don't want to come inside or are really excited. The sitter previously had texted us about how well the danes were behaving and how sweet they are. \n\nCross posted in r/greatdanes\n\nEdit to add location: TN",
