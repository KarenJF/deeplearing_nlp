                            "text": "Opinion\nWHITE, P. J.\nStatement of the Case\nIn September 1981 Gretchen Eisenberg et al., real parties in interest in the instant case (hereafter real parties), filed over 170 individual claims in small claims court against the City and County of San Francisco (hereafter appellant or San Francisco) as the owner and operator of San Francisco International Airport (hereafter airport or S.F.I.A.), alleging that noise from the airport constituted a continuing nuisance causing damages of $750 to each claimant in the 100 days preceding the filing of the claims. These cases were consolidated at the hearing on January 18, 1982. Judgment was entered in favor of 116 plaintiffs and San Francisco has appealed from the judgment to the superior court.\nReal parties filed another 183 claims against San Francisco in accordance with Government Code section 911.2 which governs the timing of filing tort claims, and a hearing was set for May 1982. That hearing was postponed because San Francisco filed a petition for a \u201cwrit of prohibition and/or mandamus\u201d in the superior court on April 14, 1982, seeking to restrain the Small Claims Division, Municipal Court, Northern Judicial District, County of San Mateo (hereafter referred to as small claims court) from proceeding to hear and determine the pending airport nuisance actions or any similar cases filed by the real parties against San Francisco arising from the same subject matter. An alternative writ of prohibition was filed on April 19, 1982, ordering respondent small claims court to show cause why a writ should not issue. Real party Gretchen Eisenberg filed a demurrer to San Francisco\u2019s petition on May 7, 1982. After an extraordinary writ proceeding the superior court issued an order on May 27, 1982, denying the writ and sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer of real party Gretchen Eisenberg. It is from this order that San Francisco appeals to this court.\nDiscussion\nThis appeal by San Francisco challenges the power of the respondent small claims court to hear a large number of individuals\u2019 claims alleging that noise from the S.F.I.A. constitutes a continuing nuisance causing damages in the amount of $750 to each claimant. It arises in the context of the consolidation of these claims by the small claims court.\nAppellant San Francisco argues on a number of grounds that these airport nuisance claims should be taken out of small claims court. As we explain in the following discussion of each of the issues raised, we disagree.\n1. Does the small claims court have jurisdiction to hear the airport nuisance cases even though they involve \u201ccomplex\u201d issues and have been filed in \u201cwaves\u201d of \u201cmass claims\" against a public entity?\nSan Francisco argues vigorously that in spite of the fact that each of the claims filed by real parties in this case alleges damages within the jurisdictional amount set out in the statute in effect at the time they were filed, they are nevertheless outside the jurisdiction of the small claims court because the Legislature never intended \u201ccomplex\u201d cases to be heard in small claims courts.\nAppellant directs our attention to the words \u201cminor civil disputes\u201d in Code of Civil Procedure section 116.1. It is useful to consider this phrase in the context of the whole section, which reads: \u201cThe Legislature hereby finds and declares that individual minor civil disputes are especially important to the parties involved and of significant social and economic consequence collectively. The Legislature further finds and declares that in order to resolve such disputes in an expeditious, inexpensive, and fair manner, it is essential to provide a judicial forum accessible to all parties directly involved in resolving such disputes. The small claims divisions of municipal and justice courts have been established to provide such a forum and thereby comprise a fundamental element in the administration of justice and the protection of the rights and property of individuals. To help fulfill this purpose, it is the intent of the Legislature that the small claims divisions of municipal and justice courts and all rules of the Judicial Council regarding small claims actions shall operate to ensure that the convenience of parties and witnesses who are individuals shall prevail, to the extent possible, over the convenience of any other parties or witnesses.\u201d\nThe language of this section makes it clear that the word \u201cminor\u201d in the first sentence refers to the financial value of the claim to the individual plaintiff. Although this is a recently added section to the statutes governing small claims courts (Stats. 1981, ch. 958, \u00a7 1), it is consistent with the view of many courts about the purpose of the small claims courts. From their inception, small claims courts have been held to exist to make it possible for plaintiffs with meritorious claims for small amounts of money, to bring these claims to court without spending more money on attorney\u2019s fees and court expenses than the claims were worth. (E.g., see Brooks v. Small Claims Court (1973) 8 Cal.3d 661, 668-670 [105 Cal.Rptr. 785, 504 P.2d 1249]; Leuschen v. Small Claims Court (1923) 191 Cal. 133, 137 [215 P. 391].)\nIn a 1926 decision which affirmed the importance and ensured the continuance of small claims courts the Supreme Court said, \u201cThe small claims court was created primarily to avoid wasteful litigation and to reduce to a minimum costs of trial in cases where the demands are small.\u201d (Hughes v. Municipal Court (1926) 200 Cal. 215, 218 [252 P. 575], italics added.) More recently the Court of Appeal in the Second District took substantially the same view when it said: \u201cA small claims process was established to provide an inexpensive and expeditious means to settle disputes over small amounts. The theory behind its organization was that ordinary litigation \u2018fails to bring practical justice\u2019 when the disputed claim is small, because the time and expense required by the ordinary litigation process is so disproportionate to the amount involved that it discourages legal resolution of die dispute.\u201d (Pace v. Hillcrest Motor Co. (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 476, 478 [161 Cal.Rptr. 622], italics added.)\nMoreover it appears from the record in the instant case that it was precisely because the cost of litigating a suit in superior court was prohibitive that real parties decided to use the small claims court. We note that had plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of a nuisance at the outset, there would have been an end to the whole matter. The plaintiff has no right to appeal from a small claims court decision, while the defendant may appeal to the superior court for a trial de novo (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 117.8), and if still unsuccessful may be granted a rehearing (Adamson v. Superior Court (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 505, 509 [169 Cal.Rptr. 866]) or other relief by extraordinary writ. (Davis v. Superior Court (1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 164, 168 [162 Cal.Rptr. 167].) This is a system which balances the poor litigant\u2019s right to a day in court, with the constitutional right of defendants not to be deprived of property without due process of law. It has been refined over hundreds of years with recurring attention from the courts, legal commentators, and the Legislature. (E.g., see Brooks v. Small Claims Court, supra, 8 Cal.3d 661; Leuschen v. Small Claims Court, supra, 191 Cal. 133, 134-137; Davis v. Superior Court, supra, at p. 167; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Small Claims Court (1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 379, 382-384 [173 P.2d 38, 167 A.L.R. 820]; Jewell, Do the Small Claims Courts Portend an Informal Trial Procedure? (1974) 49 State Bar J. 458; Roodhouse, Small Claims Court\u2014What Should It Provide and How Well Does It Do So? (1976) 51 State Bar J. 126; Review of Selected 1976 California Legislation (1977) 8 Pacific L.J. 241.) We believe it is constitutionally sound and indispensable to our system of justice.\nWe simply find no authority for appellant\u2019s argument that the airport nuisance cases, which are indeed relatively complex compared to many matters heard in small claims court, should be thrown out for that reason. Indeed appellant cites no case which supports this proposition.\nAppellant properly points out that, if the small claims court does act in excess of its jurisdiction, either as to the amount in controversy or the \u201ctype of proceeding\u201d involved, it may be restrained by a writ of prohibition and cites Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Bd. v. Small Claims Court (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 643 , 645 [111 Cal.Rptr. 6].) In the Workmen\u2019s Compensation case, a doctor who had been a witness in a worker\u2019s compensation case sued the attorney in small claims court for certain fees. On appeal it was held that the subject matter of the suit, i.e., payment of witnesses in worker\u2019s compensation cases, was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, and a writ of prohibition was issued to restrain the small claims court. (Id., at p. 647.) That decision cannot be used to support the idea that a Court of Appeal may decide sua sponte what \u201ctype\u201d of cases lower courts may hear. That is a matter for the Legislature. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 10.)\nIn the instant case real parties brought their actions alleging nuisance. It is beyond dispute that a small claims court may hear an action in nuisance. And it has recently been established that airport n\u00f3ise may give rise to a nuisance action. (Greater Westchester Homeowners Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (1979) 26 Cal.3d 86, 101 [160 Cal.Rptr. 733, 603 P.2d 1329], cert. den. 449 U.S. 820 [66 L.Ed.2d 22, 101 S.Ct 77]; see also San Diego Unified Port Dist. v. Gianturco (9th Cir. 1981) 651 F.2d 1306, p. 1313, fn. 16, cert. den. 455 U.S. 1000 [71 L.Ed.2d 866, 102 S.Ct. 1631].)\nSan Francisco relies on Sanderson v. Niemann (1941) 17 Cal.2d 563 [110 P.2d 1025]. The question in that case was whether a wife\u2019s claim for general damages in a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision was barred by the principle of estoppel since her husband had previously sued for consequential damages in small claims court to recover losses suffered by the marital community as a result of the same accident. The court held that the wife\u2019s action was a separate cause of action, and that the small claims judgment had no estoppel effect on the issues of negligence and contributory negligence, essentially because of the informal procedures of the small claims court. (Id., at p. 575.)\nWhile the Sanderson case does support San Francisco\u2019s point that many procedural devices and protections available in superior court are not available in small claims court, it does not persuade us that the airport cases may not be heard first in the less formal setting. On the contrary the Sanderson case is a good illustration of the balancing of interests which has characterized the development of small claims courts. (See cases cited in discussion, ante, at pp. 474-475.) Sanderson recognizes that small claims courts\u2019 decisions have inherent limitations. Both sides must put their cases before the court without an attorney advocate, accept relaxed rules of evidence, and do without the usual discovery process. The plaintiff who chooses this forum has elected to accept these limitations and must accept the court\u2019s decision as final. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 117.8.) Yet the defendant has the right to appeal to the superior court for a trial de novo. (Ibid.) And under Sanderson, if there is no appeal from the small claims court\u2019s judgment, the parties are protected from any inappropriate extension of that decision, since issues resolved in that court may not operate as an estoppel in a later action.\nSan Francisco also argues, though it cites no supporting authority, that \u201cbroad social policy impact\u201d of the airport nuisance cases also makes them inappropriate for an initial resolution in small claims court. In view of the Legislature\u2019s explicit recognition that small claims cases have \u201csignificant social and economic consequence collectively\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 116.1) this cannot, be the basis for a jurisdictional challenge. Indeed the Supreme Court in City of Long Beach v. Bozek (1982) 31 Cal.3d 527, 532 [183 Cal.Rptr. 86, 645 P.2d 137], judgment vacated and case remanded (1983) 459 U.S. 1095 [74 L.Ed.2d 943, 103 S.Ct. 712], proceedings on remand pending (holding that municipalities may not sue for malicious prosecution) said that filing suit against a governmental entity is an aspect of the constitutional right to petition for the redress of grievances. In addition \u201cthe right encompasses the act of filing a lawsuit solely to obtain monetary compensation for individualized wrongs, as well as filing suit to draw attention to issues of broader public interest or political significance.\u201d (Id., at p. 534, italics added.) The right to access to the courts which the Supreme Court emphatically defends in Bozek (id., at p. 533) includes the right of access to small claims courts.\nSan Francisco also cites City of San Jose v. Superior Court (1974) 12 Cal. 3d 447 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223], to support the argument that the complexity of the issues should take these cases out of small claims court. In the San Jose case, the Supreme Court affirmed the denial of class certification of plaintiffs suing the city alleging nuisance and inverse condemnation because of airport noise. The court reasoned \u201cthat a class action cannot be maintained where each member\u2019s right to recover depends on facts peculiar to his case\u201d (id., at p. 459), and held that the class failed for lack of community of interest and failure of the named plaintiffs to adequately represent the class. (Id., at p. 461.)\nThe concerns of the San Jose court are significantly different from those raised by the instant appeal. The plaintiffs there, once certified as a class, would remain a class through all levels of appellate review. Any unfairness to defendant resulting from the certification could not be cured on appeal. In the instant case, however, as we have discussed ante at pages 474-475, appellant\u2019s right to a trial de novo in superior court is a cure for the informal procedures of small claims court which appellant decries.\nSan Francisco objects further to the \u201cmass filing\u201d of these claims, complaining that its ultimate liability may exceed $135,000. It is well settled that the jurisdictional amount limitations apply to each plaintiff\u2019s individual claim, so that in a consolidated action the fact that the aggregate amount of the claims is greater does not create a jurisdictional defect. (1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) pp. 559-560.)\nAs to San Francisco\u2019s complaint that real parties continue to file \u201cwaves\u201d of claims, the Supreme Court has said: \u201cIf the defendant is not privileged to con tinue the nuisance and is able to abate it, he cannot complain if the plaintiff elects to bring successive actions as damages accrue until abatement takes place.\u201d (Spaulding v. Cameron (1952) 38 Cal.2d 265, 268 [239 P.2d 625].) It is not for this court to determine whether a nuisance exists, nor whether it is permanent or abatable. These are issues for the trial court. Their relevance for the jurisdictional issue before this court is this: unless and until there is a determination that the allegedly excess airport noise is a permanent nuisance which the airport is privileged to continue, the laws of this state allow real parties to file successive actions based on nuisance.\n2. Has San Francisco been denied equal protection of the law?\nAppellant argues that because it must defend claims worth over $135,000 in the aggregate without the full panoply of procedural devices and protections available in municipal or superior court, it has been denied equal protection of the law. The assertion that it is \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to a defendant in a different type of court, where one plaintiff alone could sue to recover that amount, and where plaintiffs as well as defendants would have more procedural rights, is spurious. There is no \u201cparticular burden\u201d imposed on a municipality or municipal public utility by requiring it to defend actions in small claims courts. San Francisco is subject to the same rules as other defendants in small claims courts, including the provisions for consolidation and the method of determining jurisdictional amount.\n3. Have real parties violated Code of Civil Procedure section 117.4?\nBy their own admission real parties have consulted attorneys and other legal advisers and have met together numerous times to discuss what to do about the noise from S.F.I.A. They contend that all of this activity was constitutionally protected as collective activity undertaken to petition for the redress of grievances. We agree.\nReal parties rely on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in United Transportation Union v. Michigan Bar (1971) 401 U.S. 576 [28 L.Ed.2d 339, 91 S.Ct. 1076], identifying it as one of a long line of cases protecting the right of groups to act collectively to seek legal redress. (See N. A. A. C. P. v. Button (1963) 371 U.S. 415, 428-432 [9 L.Ed.2d 405, 415-417, 83 S.Ct. 328]; Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia Bar (1963) 377 U.S. 1, 5-6 [12 L.Ed.2d 89, 92-93, 84 S.Ct. 1113, 11 A.L.R.3d 1196]; Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn. (1967) 389 U.S. 217, 221-222 [19 L.Ed.2d 426, 429-430, 88 S.Ct. 353]; see also Matossian v. Fahmie (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 128, 136-137 [161 Cal.Rptr. 532].)\nIn the United Transportation case a labor union had set limits on the fees which recommended attorneys could charge union members pressing claims against their employers. The court said this practice must be allowed because \u201ccollective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right within the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d (Id., at p. 585 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 346].) It also said, \u201cHowever, that right would be a hollow promise if courts could deny associations of workers or others the means of enabling their members to meet the costs of legal representation.\u201d (Id., at pp. 585-586 [28 L.Ed.2d at p. 347], italics added.)\nAppellant points to the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 117.4; \u201cNo attorney at law or other person than the plaintiff and the defendant shall take any part in the filing or the prosecution or defense of such litigation in small claims court . . . .\u201d San Francisco maintains that certain activities in which real parties have engaged are a violation of this section and change the nature of the claims so that they are not \u201cindividual\u201d and thus cannot be heard in small claims court.\nUnder existing law real parties could not be certified as a class essentially because of the individuality of their claims. (City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, 12 Cal.3d 447.) The fact that they have exercised their constitutional right to meet together \u201cto assist and advise each other\u201d (Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia Bar, supra, 377 U.S. 1, 6 [12 L.Ed.2d 89, 93]) in organizing and filing their claims does not change the fundamental reality that each petitioner had a valid individual claim. Appellant does not challenge the testimony given by one of the admitted \u201corganizers\u201d to the effect that each claimant individually signed a claim, paid a filing fee, and alleged damages for personal injury arising from airport noise.\nWe cannot read the small claims statutes as denying these plaintiffs access to the court on the basis of who handed the papers to the filing clerk. The United States Supreme Court has said, \u201cWe start with the premise that the rights to assemble peaceably and to petition for a redress of grievances are among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights. These rights, moreover, are intimately connected, both in origin and in purpose, with the other First Amendment rights of free speech and free press. . . . The First Amendment would, however, be a hollow promise if it left government free to destroy or erode its guarantees by indirect restraints so long as no law is passed that prohibits free speech, press, petition, or assembly as such. \u201d (Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., supra, 389 U.S. 217, 222 [19 L.Ed.2d 426, 430].)\nSan Francisco\u2019s reading of Code of Civil Procedure section 117.4 requires an interpretation which would conflict with the fundamental right of citizens to act collectively when seeking access to the courts. Following the principle that the Legislature is presumed to write laws which are constitutional, we cannot agree with San Francisco\u2019s reading of this statute.\nWe are further persuaded that real parties have in no way abused the small claims process since the Legislature itself has recently made mandatory the establishment of advisory services for small claims litigants. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 117.18.)\nThe new law provides: \u201cIn each county, individual assistance shall be made available to advise small claims court litigants and potential litigants at no additional charge. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each county may determine the characteristics of the advisory service in accordance with local needs and conditions. The advisory service may be provided in person, by telephone, or by any other means reasonably calculated to provide timely and appropriate assistance. Adjacent counties may provide advisory services jointly. The service shall operate in conjunction and cooperation with the small claims division of the courts, but shall be administered in such a manner as to be independent of control of the court. Persons providing assistance may be volunteers and shall be members of the State Bar, law students, paralegals, or persons experienced in resolving minor disputes and familiar with small claims court rules and procedures. Persons providing assistance shall not appear in court as an advocate for any party. ...\u201d\nThis provision is consistent with other language in the statute, found in the very section which appellant argues that real parties have violated, i.e., \u201cNothing herein shall prevent an attorney from rendering advice to a party to such [small claims] litigation, either before or after the commencement of such an action, ...\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 117.4.)\nThus, it appears that all the activities of the \u201ccoordinators\u201d of real parties to which San Francisco objects are allowed under the small claims statute and are constitutionally protected.\nSince we find no violation of the statute we do not reach the issue of whether an extraordinary writ may issue to restrain its violation.\nConclusion\nReal parties have engaged in concerted action to assist each other in preparing and filing claims alleging damages of $750 each arising from noise connected with the operation of the airport. We hold that the respondent small claims court has jurisdiction to hear these cases. The judgment of the superior court denying San Francisco\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandate and sustaining real party\u2019s demurrer is affirmed.\nScott, J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.\nA petition for a rehearing was denied April 27, 1983, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.\nThe jurisdictional limit for small claims actions at the time these claims were filed was $750. Code of Civil Procedure section 116.2 has since been amended to raise the monetary jurisdiction of all small claims to $1,500. (Stats. 1981, ch. 957, \u00a7 1.)\nAt the extraordinary writ proceedings the judge observed, \u201cI have heard small claims cases and there were some very complex issues involved. Sometimes more complex than at the Trial Court.\u201d\nThe court in Sanderson discusses estoppel as one aspect of res judicata. It observed that res judicata has two aspects. The first is when a judgment \u201cconstitutes a complete bar against a second suit on the same cause of action, ...\u201d (Id., at p. 573, italics in original.) The second aspect is when \u201cin a second suit upon a different cause of action [the judgment in the first suit] constitutes but an estoppel or conclusive determination of such issues only as were actually raised and litigated.\u201d (Ibid., italics in original.) For clarity we refer to this \u201csecond aspect\u201d of res judicata as an estoppel effect. (See Black\u2019s Law Diet. (4th ed. 1968 rev.) p. 650.)\nWe note that San Francisco does not challenge the consolidation of real parties\u2019 claims, a position which would be more analogous to that of the City of San Jose in the case cited.\nThe activities of certain \u201ccoordinators\u201d to which appellant objects but which are constitutionally protected and are not precluded by the statute include: (1) reviewing records of the Noise Abatement Center at the airport to discover the names of potential plaintiffs; (2) preparing, circulating and filing (in the sense of carrying the papers to the courthouse after individuals had signed and attached filing fees) \u201cmaster\u201d small claims complaints; (3) hiring and consulting attorneys before and after filing claims; (4) holding \u201cworkshops\u201d and other meetings at which participants discussed and attorneys offered advice on the presentation of testimony; (5) filing a brief written by or with the assistance of a nonattorney legal adviser, and (6) hiring expert witnesses to testify on behalf of all plaintiffs.",

                            "text": "Opinion\nTAYLOR, P. J.\nPetitioner, Workmen's Compensation Appeals Board, seeks prohibition to prevent respondent, Small Claims Court, San Leandro-Hayward Judicial District, from proceeding to trial on two small claims actions on the ground that the subject matter of the actions is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.\nThe board has supplemented the record originally presented to us by providing copies of the claims filed in the small claims court and of its order approving compromise and release in the matter of Clifford Shans v. Early-Winston-Drake and National Surety Corporation of California, case No. 69 OAK 30031, filed January 31, 1973. An examination of the record, as supplemented by the board, discloses that the matter arose when respondent, Dr. Milton Righetti, dissatisfied with a $250 award for his services as a medical witness for respondent, Clifford Shans, in a workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding, filed an action in respondent, small claims court, against respondent, Homer Sidlow, one of several attorneys who had represented the claimant and with whom he had consultations, seeking an additional $350 for \u201cconsultation and hearing-appearance service.\u201d Respondent Sidlow countered by claiming respondent Righetti was indebted to him in the sum of $400 for \u201closs of Workmen\u2019s Compensation award for attorney fees.\u201d\nRespondent Sidlow also filed a separate action in respondent small claims court against respondent Shans, his former client in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding, seeking to recover $350 (in the event respondent Righetti should recover against him) by virtue of the fact that respondent Shans had executed a \u201csave harmless\u201d agreement that he would pay any fees owed to the doctor.\nWe need not discuss the merits of the claims of respondents Righetti or Sidlow, for it is clear that both parties are pressing their claims in the wrong forum. \u201cA court has no jurisdiction to hear or determine a case where the type of proceeding or the amount in controversy is beyond the jurisdiction defined for that particular court by statute or constitutional provision\u201d (Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal (1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715]; italics added).\nThe California Constitution (art. XX, \u00a7 21) envisions a \u201ccomplete system of workmen\u2019s compensation,\u201d a purpose which the Legislature has sought to implement by appropriate legislation (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3201). The Legislature, by statute, has vested the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board with exclusive jurisdiction to fix the fees of medical witnesses and of attorneys representing the claimants in matters before the board (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a74600, 5300, 5304, 5955).\nMedical witnesses may file lien claims with the board, pursuant to Labor Code section 4903, subdivision (b), for the reasonable value of their services. Attorneys may file lien claims, pursuant to the provisions of Labor Code section 4903, subdivision (a), for the reasonable value of legal services rendered to the claimant and for reasonable disbursements in connection therewith.\nLabor Code section 4906 provides that \u201cNo charge, claim, or agreement for legal services or disbursements mentioned in subdivision (a) of Section 4903, or for the expense mentioned in subdivision (b) of Section 4903, is enforceable, valid, or binding in excess of a reasonable amount. The appeals board may determine what constitutes such reasonable amount.\u201d The purpose of section 4906 is to protect claimants before the board from the exaction of excessive fees. It constitutes professional misconduct for an attorney to secure or attempt to secure fees in excess of those allowed by the board (Coviello v. State Bar, 41 Cal.2d 273, 276 [259 P.2d 7]; see also Koker v. Elk Brass Mfg. Co. (1971) (appeals board en banc opinion) 36 Cal. Comp. Cases 292, 294).\nA hen claimant who deems himself aggrieved by the board\u2019s award is not without a remedy. By statute, he may petition the board for reconsideration (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5900) and thereafter may seek review (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5950). Respondents Righetti and Sidlow may not circumvent the remedy provided by statute by filing actions in the small claims court.\nBecause the subject matter of the actions filed in respondent small claims court is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, respondent small claims court has no jurisdiction to hear or determine the claims.\nLet a writ of prohibition issue commanding respondent small claims court to dismiss the actions in small claims cases Nos. 343233-8 and 343323-4, and to cease and desist from any further proceedings in these matters.\nKane, J., and Rouse, J., concurred.\nBy directing the issuance of an alternative writ of prohibition and transferring the matter to us, the Supreme Court necessarily determined that there is no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and that this case is a proper one for the exercise of original jurisdiction (City & County of S. F. v. Superior Court (1959) 53 Cal.2d 236, 243 [1 Cal.Rptr. 158, 347 P.2d 294]; see also Brooks v. Small Claims Court (1973) 8 Cal.3d 661, 663 [105 Cal.Rptr. 785, 504 P.2d 1249] (mandate); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 56(a)).\nUnder the terms of the award, Sidlow had been awarded the sum of $100 for his past services; the attorney representing Shans at the time the award was made was awarded $500.\nThe typical methods of preventing a court from proceeding in a case over which it has no jurisdiction, such as a motion to dismiss the proceedings for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter, or a special demurrer raising the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter (Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Jurisdiction, pp. 809-810), are unavailable to a defendant in a small claims action, as the nature and organization of the small claims court is such as to dispense with formal pleadings such as motions and demurrers, the sole object being to dispense speedy justice between the parties in an informal manner without the necessity for representation by an attorney (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 117g, 117h; Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Courts, pp. 451-459).\nLabor Code section 4600 provides, in part, as follows: \u201cIn accordance with the rules of practice and procedure of the appeals board, the employee, or the dependents of a deceased employee, shall be reimbursed for expenses reasonably, actually,. and necessarily incurred for X-rays, laboratory fees, medical reports, and medical testimony to prove a contested claim. The reasonableness of and necessity for incurring such expenses to prove a contested claim shall be determined with respect to the time when such expenses were actually incurred. Expenses of medical testimony shall be presumed reasonable if in conformity with the fee schedule charges provided for impartial medical experts appointed by the administrative director.\u201d\nAn attorney representing a claimant in a workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding is entitled to have the board carefully appraise the value of the services shown to have been rendered (Bentley v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 547, 549 [171 P.2d 532]). The basis upon which fees are fixed should not be so low as to discourage competent attorneys from practicing in the field (Bentley, supra, p. 550; Wasserman v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board (1968) 33 Cal. Comp. Cases 790, 793).\nAttempts to obtain additional amounts may also result in the loss of the privilege to practice before the board (Lab. Code, \u00a74907; In the Matter of Franz (1972) (appeals board en banc opinion) 37 Cal. Comp. Cases 256, 259).",

The adjudication order declared Kyle a ward of the court and sustained a petition that the People filed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 alleging that Kyle had committed one count of felony vandalism (Pen. Code, \u00a7 594, subds. (a), (b)(1)), one count each of misdemeanor vandalism (id., subd. (b)(2)), and misdemeanor possession of an aerosol container with intent to vandalize (id., \u00a7 594.1, subd. (e)(1)). The disposition order directed that Kyle be placed in a suitable juvenile detention facility for a maximum of three years.\nKyle argues on appeal that there is insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding on the felony vandalism count that Kyle caused $400 or more in property damage, which is the amount of damage necessary to punish vandalism as a felony rather than as a misdemeanor. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 594, subd. (b)(1) & (2).) We agree. In our view, the People failed to present sufficient evidence, specific to Kyle\u2019s acts of vandalism, demonstrating that the actual amount of damage he caused reached the felony vandalism threshold of $400. Therefore, we reverse the adjudication order in part and instruct the juvenile court to reduce the felony vandalism count to a misdemeanor vandalism count. We also reverse the disposition order and remand for a new disposition consistent with the reduction of the felony count to a misdemeanor.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOn the night of May 28, 2015, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Jonathan Chavez noticed what appeared to be fresh blue graffiti, also known as \u201ctagging,\u201d on an abandoned building at 2231 South Barrington Avenue in Los Angeles that was owned by the City of Los Angeles (City). Officer Chavez read the tagging to contain the word \u201cFrost\u201d or \u201cFrosty,\u201d as well as the initials \u201cJRH,\u201d and he estimated that the size of the tagging was two feet by three feet. A passerby whom Officer Chavez encountered near that building pointed down the street and stated, \u201cHe\u2019s over there tagging now.\u201d Based on the passerby\u2019s tip, Officer Chavez alerted other officers who were working in the area. One of those officers, Gina Roh, found fresh blue tagging with the initials \u201cJRH\u201d on the south side wall of 2250 South Barrington Avenue, which also was City-owned. Additionally, Officer Roh saw fresh blue spray paint with the word \u201cFrost\u201d at Hai\u2019s Liquor, a nearby store. Officer Roh was uncertain of the size of the tagging at 2250 South Barrington Avenue and Hai\u2019s Liquor.\nLater that same night, Officer Samuel Leon spotted Kyle walking along South Barrington Avenue and stopped him. Kyle confessed to Officer Leon, \u201cI did it. I was painting the wall because I was bored.\u201d Kyle showed Officer Leon his waistband, where he had a can of blue spray paint and a paint marker; Kyle had blue paint on his fingers as well.\nOn July 20, 2015, pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, the People filed a three-count petition alleging Kyle, who was then 17 years old, had committed: (1) felony vandalism by defacing with graffiti walls of properties owned by the City, causing damage to that property in an amount over $400 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 594, subd. (a); count 1); (2) misdemeanor vandalism by defacing with graffiti the wall at Hai\u2019s Liquor, causing damage to that property in an amount under $400 {id., subd. (b)(2); count 2); and (3) misdemeanor possession of an aerosol paint container with the intent to deface {id., \u00a7 594.1, subd. (e)(1); count 3).\nThe adjudication hearing on the petition was tried in front of the juvenile court on September 22, 2015. Officer Miguel Barragan was the lone prosecution witness to testify whether, for purposes of the petition\u2019s felony vandalism count, the amount of damage that Kyle caused to the two City-owned properties on South Barrington Avenue was $400 or more. Officer Barragan testified that he previously had handled vandalism cases and that part of his assignment is to determine the cost of repairing walls and other structures damaged by vandalism. The prosecutor asked him, \u201c[H]ow is it that you go about determining the dollar amount of City property that needs to be repaired due to vandalism or tagging?\u201d Officer Barragan answered, \u201c[F]or City properties, we have a graffiti removal cost list. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] It is issued by the [City] for my investigations on how to come up with estimates of removal of graffiti.\u201d\nWith implicit reference to the dimensions of the tagging at 2231 South Barrington Avenue, the prosecutor asked Officer Barragan, \u201cDoes [the graffiti removal cost list] have a dollar amount for how much it costs to approximate [sic] a two- by three-foot tag on a wall?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Officer Barragan answered. \u201cWhat is that dollar amount?,\u201d the prosecutor asked. Kyle\u2019s counsel objected to that question on the grounds of hearsay and lack of foundation. The court overruled the objections, and Officer Barragan responded, \u201cAccording to the graffiti removal cost list, it is $400 for each incident of removing graffiti.\u201d Applying that per-incident rate, Officer Barragan stated that it would cost a total of $1,200 to remove the three tags on the two City-owned properties (two tags on one wall at 2231 South Barrington Avenue and one tag at 2250 South Barrington Avenue).\nOn cross-examination, Officer Barragan stated that the graffiti removal cost list was one page long. He conceded that he did not prepare the list\u2014 someone else, whom he did not identify, prepared it. Nor was Officer Barragan able to explain how the list\u2019s cost removal determinations were made. Officer Barragan also conceded that he was unaware whether any repairs had been made to the two City-owned properties in question. Additionally, he conceded that he was unaware of the cost of materials to make the repairs. And he conceded that he did not know how long it would take to make the repairs and how many people would be needed to make them. Officer Barragan did say that he had visited the two properties as part of his investigation. But he acknowledged that his repair cost figures were based entirely on the graffiti cost removal list.\nAt the close of their case, the People did not offer into evidence the graffiti removal cost list, photographs of the tagging, or any other document.\nAfter the People rested, Kyle\u2019s counsel made an oral motion to reduce the petition\u2019s felony vandalism count to a misdemeanor, \u201cbased on the testimony of the evaluation of the cost of repair.\u201d The court denied the motion.\nKyle did not testify or present any evidence in his defense. After the People waived closing argument, Kyle\u2019s counsel renewed his argument that the felony vandalism count should be reduced to a misdemeanor because any damage Kyle caused to the City-owned properties was less than $400. The court again denied the request. The court then proceeded to sustain the felony vandalism count, as well as the petition\u2019s two misdemeanor counts, and memorialized its findings in an adjudication order.\nFollowing an October 19, 2015 disposition hearing, the juvenile court ordered Kyle suitably placed in a \u201cLevel 14 facility,\u201d with a maximum period of confinement of three years.\nKyle\u2019s appeal was timely.\nDISCUSSION\nA. Standard of Review and Governing Law\nOur review of a claim of insufficiency of the evidence in a juvenile criminal case is governed by the same deferential standard that applies to an insufficiency of the evidence claim in an adult criminal case. (In re V.V. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1020, 1026 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 421, 252 P.3d 979].) Under that standard, we determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the fight most favorable to the prosecution, any reasonable fact finder could have found the elements of the crime to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. (Ibid.) We do not reweigh the evidence or reevaluate the credibility of witnesses (People v. Jennings (2010) 50 Cal.4th 616, 638 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 133, 237 P.3d 474]); and we presume the existence of every fact the trier of fact reasonably could infer from the evidence (In re V.V., supra, at p. 1026). \u201c \u2018 \u201cA reasonable inference, however, \u2018may not be based ... on imagination, speculation, supposition, surmise, conjecture or guess work.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Sifuentes (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1416 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 903].)\nVandalism is proscribed by section 594 of the Penal Code. A person commits vandalism if he or she maliciously defaces with graffiti (or other inscribed material), damages, or destroys any real or personal property that is not his or her own. (Id., subd. (a).) Vandalism may be punished as a felony, but only \u201c[i]f the amount of defacement, damage, or destruction is four hundred dollars ($400) or more . . . .\u201d (Id., subd. (b)(1).) Damage of less than $400 is punishable solely as a misdemeanor. (Id., subd. (b)(2).)\nB. The Evidence Was Insufficient to Support the Felony Vandalism Finding\nKyle contends that there is insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s felony vandalism finding that he caused $400 or more in damage to the two City-owned properties that were the subject of the felony vandalism count. Kyle is right. The People failed to present individualized proof, specific to the facts of this case, that the actual amount of damage that Kyle\u2019s vandalism caused reached the $400 threshold necessary to sustain the felony vandalism count.\nPenal Code section 594 does not itself specify a method for proving the amount of property damage in a vandalism prosecution, and there are no reported decisions on that subject. By contrast, there are \u201ctwo statutory approaches,\u201d and reported decisions analyzing those approaches, for determining the amount of a restitution award arising from the abatement of juvenile vandalism of property. (Luis M. v. Superior Court (2014) 59 Cal.4th 300, 307 [173 Cal.Rptr.3d 37, 326 P.3d 969] (Luis M.).) First, section 730.6, subdivision (h) of the Welfare and Institutions Code \u201cauthorizes full restitution for economic losses, including \u2018the actual cost of repairing [damaged] property when repair is possible.\u2019 ([Welf. & Inst. Code,] \u00a7 730.6, subd. (h)(1) . . . .) Awards under [Welfare and Institutions Code] section 730.6 are based on proof of the damage actually linked to the minor\u2019s conduct {Luis M., at p. 307.) This method for determining restitution arising from the abatement of juvenile vandalism \u201cparallel[s]\u201d the method for determining restitution arising from the abatement of adult vandalism set forth in Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (1). (Luis M., at p. 304; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(A) [restitution shall be of a dollar amount sufficient to fully reimburse the victim for every determined economic loss \u201cincurred as the result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct\u201d; the \u201cvalue of . . . damaged property shall be . . . the actual cost of repairing the property when repair is possible\u201d].) Second, the graffiti removal and damage recovery program (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 742.10 et seq.) authorizes restitution \u201cbased on the average costs for graffiti investigation and remediation per unit of measure,\u201d provided that criteria set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code section 742.14 are met (Luis M., at p. 307).\nAs the People acknowledge, the standard of proof in a restitution case is less exacting than the standard of proof in a vandalism case. Thus, failure to meet the lower restitution standard would, by definition, mean failure to meet the standard of proof of the underlying crime. Here, the evidence of property damage that the People presented does not satisfy either the \u201cactual cost\u201d or \u201caverage cost\u201d method for determining restitution awards.\n1. The People Provided Insufficient Evidence of the Actual Cost to Repair the Property Damage Kyle Caused\nThe most obvious way for the People to prove that Kyle committed felony vandalism would have been to introduce at the adjudication hearing an invoice setting forth the actual cost of repairs to the two properties. No such evidence was introduced. The absence of an invoice may have been because the City had not completed repairs as of the hearing date. Indeed, Officer Barragan testified he did not know whether that work had been done. Had the People introduced an invoice showing actual repair costs of $400 or more, properly authenticated the invoice, and laid a proper foundation, the trial court could have found that Kyle committed felony vandalism and we would not have disturbed that finding.\nThis is not to say that it was necessary for the City already to have made repairs in order for the trial court to find felony vandalism\u2014a contractor\u2019s estimate of the cost to repair the actual damage that Kyle caused might have sufficed, again assuming proper authentication and foundation. But the People offered no such estimate either.\nThe one-page graffiti cost removal list formed the basis of Officer Barragan\u2019s damages calculation. Because the People did not introduce the list itself and therefore it is not in the record on appeal, we are unaware of its exact contents. What we know about the list is based on Officer Barragan\u2019s description of it. And based on that description, we know that the list did not contain an invoice of actual repair costs. We also know that the list is not an estimate of the actual cost to repair the damage that Kyle caused. Rather, the list apparently sets forth a generic, one-size-fits-all removal cost of $400 for every incident of graffiti on City-owned property. From what Officer Barragan said, this mechanistic flat rate seems to control the City\u2019s damages calculation in all cases, regardless of the particulars of a given incident, such as the graffiti\u2019s dimensions, the type of material used in creating the graffiti, the nature of the surface on which the graffiti was written, and the method and manpower employed for cleaning up the graffiti. In short, the fist reflects a generalized, non-case-specific damages estimate, not an estimate tethered to the facts of Kyle\u2019s vandalism.\nThis deficiency of the graffiti cost removal fist is underscored by Officer Barragan\u2019s acknowledgement that he knew neither the length of time it would take to repair the damages that Kyle caused nor the number of people necessary to make the repairs, as well as his acknowledgment that he did not know the cost of the materials to repair that damage. The list\u2019s flat rate of $400 per incident thus bears, at best, an attenuated correlation to the cost of removing the graffiti for which Kyle was responsible.\nTo make matters worse, Officer Barragan was unable to explain how the list was prepared and hence how its flat rate of $400 per incident was even derived in the first place. This has left us wondering whether or not it was just a coincidence that the list\u2019s damages calculation hit Penal Code section 594\u2019s felony vandalism mark of $400 right on the nose.\nThe People argue that Officer Barragan\u2019s damages estimate was not based solely on the graffiti cost removal list, but also on his review of the photographs of the graffiti on the two City-owned properties and his observations of the graffiti during his visit to those sites. Yes, Officer Barragan did review the photographs, and he did visit the sites. However, neither the photographs nor any notes summarizing his site visit were introduced into evidence. And more fundamentally, Officer Barragan testified unequivocally that his damage estimate was based exclusively on the graffiti cost removal list.\nThe People\u2019s contention that the juvenile court could determine the amount of damage based on the testimony of Officers Chavez and Roh, not just Officer Barragan\u2019s, is incorrect. Officers Chavez and Roh both testified only about their observations of the tagging. Neither testified regarding the extent of the damage the tagging caused.\nBecause Officer Barragan was the only prosecution witness who testified regarding damages, and his damage calculation was predicated on the graffiti cost removal list, the juvenile court\u2019s felony vandalism finding necessarily rested on the list. And because the list\u2019s damages calculation was not tied to the specific facts of this case, the court\u2019s finding fails to satisfy even the relaxed scrutiny of sufficiency of the evidence review. The list is an insufficient basis for the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Kyle caused $400 or more in damages to the City-owned properties and the resulting imposition of felony punishment on Kyle.\nReported decisions on the \u201cactual cost\u201d method for determining restitution awards arising from vandalism support our conclusion. Under this method, the amount of the award \u201cmust have some factual nexus to the damage caused by the [juvenile\u2019s] conduct.\u201d (Luis M., supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 309; see also Luis M., at p. 307; Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 730.6.)\nIn Luis M., the government entity seeking restitution failed to satisfy that standard because it \u201chad no information about the actual abatement costs related to [the juvenile\u2019s] conduct.\u201d (Luis M., supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 304.) In particular, the entity introduced no photographs of the juvenile\u2019s graffiti. (Id. at pp. 303-304.) And it provided \u201cno evidence about the materials, equipment, and labor required to remove it.\u201d (Id. at p. 309.) Under those circumstances, the restitution award was reversed. Luis M. highlights the problems with the People\u2019s felony vandalism case against Kyle. Just as in Luis M., no photographs of Kyle\u2019s graffiti were introduced into evidence, and no evidence was offered regarding the cost of labor and materials to remove Kyle\u2019s graffiti.\nPeople v. Santori (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 122 [196 Cal.Rptr.3d 500] is in sharp contrast to Luis M. and our case. In Santori, the restitution award was based on an estimate of the amount of damage actually caused by the defendant\u2019s graffiti, including manpower necessary to remove the graffiti, not an average based on other incidents of graffiti. (Santori, at pp. 126-127.) Under those circumstances, the award was upheld.\nIn People v. Aguilar (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 857, 860 [209 Cal.Rptr.3d 313], the City derived its claimed amount of restitution from \u201c \u2018a graffiti removal cost sheet which lists different surfaces and the costs of graffiti removal from those particular surfaces.\u2019 \u201d Whether this is the same list on which Officer Barragan predicated his damages calculation in this case is unclear. In Aguilar, however, the City\u2019s damages witness did not tie his damages calculation to a per-incident rate generated by the fist. Instead, in making his calculation, the witness considered photographs depicting the graffiti at issue in the case, the \u201csize and extent of the graffiti,\u201d the need \u201cfor an expedited removal\u201d (it was on a children\u2019s day care center) and \u201cthe costs of both paint and manpower.\u201d (Id. at p. 865.) Aguilar reflects a case-specific damages determination and thus is quite different from the generalized damages determination on which the juvenile court\u2019s felony vandalism finding here rests.\n2. The Graffiti Cost Removal List Fails to Satisfy the Criteria for Use of Average Costs in Restitution Cases\nThe average cost method for determining restitution awards appears to bear some resemblance to the per-incident damages calculation of the graffiti cost removal fist on which the juvenile court\u2019s felony vandalism finding in this case rests. As the People acknowledge, however, Welfare and Institutions Code section 742.14 does not authorize use of the average cost method beyond the restitution context. In any event, we question whether this method could be applied constitutionally to the adjudication of vandalism allegations against a juvenile in a Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition. Our doubts flow from the distinction between a restitution proceeding and an adjudication proceeding. A juvenile who comes out on the wrong end of a restitution proceeding is not deprived of his or her liberty. The juvenile is simply ordered to pay money, as would be the case following a civil judgment. The standard of proof in a restitution proceeding requires an entity seeking restitution for acts of vandalism to make only a prima facie showing of the amount of damage; the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of damage is less than that amount. (People v. Santori, supra, 243 Cal.App.4th at p. 126.)\nBy contrast, a juvenile who comes out on the wrong end of the adjudication of a Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition alleging vandalism may be deprived of his or her liberty. Accordingly, the standard of proof is the same as in an adult criminal case: the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile committed acts of vandalism, and, if felony vandalism is alleged, that the damage the juvenile caused is $400 or more. (In re Winship (1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068]; CALCRIM No. 2901.)\nIt is one thing to use the average cost method used to determine the amount of restitution for juvenile vandalism. It is quite another thing to use that method to determine whether a juvenile\u2019s vandalism is subject to punishment as a felony. The imposition of that degree of punishment should be based on the damage the juvenile actually caused, not on the average damage that other juveniles cause. The graffiti cost removal fist bases the imposition of felony penalties on a per-incident average. We need not decide if this mode of determining punishment would be constitutional. For even if the average cost method of Welfare and Institutions Code section 742.14 applies outside the restitution setting, the graffiti cost removal fist does not satisfy the statutory criteria. Among other requirements, average cost determinations for calculating restitution awards must be reviewed every three years by government entities using that method. (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 742.14; Luis M., supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 308.) There is no evidence that the graffiti cost removal list was subject to such a review.\nDISPOSITION\nThe adjudication order is reversed in part. The juvenile court is instructed to reduce the felony vandalism count to a misdemeanor vandalism count. The adjudication order is affirmed in all other respects. The disposition order is reversed. We remand for a new disposition consistent with the reduction of the felony count to a misdemeanor.\nZelon, Acting P. J., and Segal, J., concurred.\nA petihon for a rehearing was denied March 30, 2017.\nJudge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.\nFor purposes of the misdemeanor vandalism count, the juvenile court accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation that the amount of damage to Hai\u2019s Liquor was under $400.\nIn rendering that disposition, the court aggregated the petition in this case with two prior petitions filed against Kyle, both of which resulted in Kyle admitting to allegations of vandalism in connection with settlements of the petitions. (See Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 726, subd. (d); John L. v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 158, 183 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 261, 91 P.3d 205] [the juvenile court may aggregate terms of confinement for multiple Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 602 counts or petitions, including previously sustained petitions].)\nKyle does not dispute that he committed acts of vandalism\u2014he contends only that those acts did not rise to the level of felony vandalism.\nKyle objected on hearsay and foundation grounds to Officer Barragan\u2019s testimony about the list at the adjudication healing. The trial court overruled the objection. Because Kyle does not contest the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on appeal, we do not address it.\nInitially, Officer Barragan testified that the list states it costs $400 to remove graffiti having the dimensions (two feet by three feet) of the graffiti on the wall at 2231 South Barrington Avenue. Subsequently, however. Officer Barragan indicated that it also would cost $400 to remove the graffiti on the wall at 2250 South Barrington Avenue, the dimensions of which were never specified in the record.\nAt the adjudication hearing, the prosecution suggested that the stipulated $100 worth of damage to Hai\u2019s Liquor could be aggregated with the damage to the City-owned properties for purposes of calculating whether the felony vandalism level of $400 or more in damage was reached. As a general proposition, acts of vandalism that cause less than $400 in damage may be aggregated to form the predicate for a felony vandalism charge. (See In re Arthur V. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 61, 68 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 148].) Here, however, the damage to Hai\u2019s Liquor was not alleged in petition\u2019s felony vandalism count\u2014it was alleged in the misdemeanor vandalism count only. The incorporation of the misdemeanor vandalism damage to Hai\u2019s Liquor in tallying felony vandalism damages thus would have been impermissible. (In re Robert G. (1982) 31 Cal.3d 437, 445 [182 Cal.Rptr. 644, 644 P.2d 837].) The People do not advocate for such aggregation on appeal.",

Prior to his plea, Armijo sent two letters to the trial court expressing concern that the public defenders assigned to represent him had provided ineffective assistance. Armijo requested in the letters that the court discharge those attorneys and appoint replacement counsel. Armijo contends that his plea and conviction should be vacated because the trial court committed reversible error under People v. Marsden (1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44] (Marsden) by failing to hold a hearing on his requests.\nWe agree with Armijo that Marsden error occurred here. Armijo\u2019s request in his first letter became moot when, through no action of the trial court itself, the attorneys about whom Armijo complained in that letter were replaced by another court-appointed counsel. However, the trial court later erred in failing to hold a Marsden hearing on Armijo\u2019s second letter, which requested the discharge of the replacement counsel and the substitution of another counsel. On the record before us, this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we conditionally reverse the judgment and remand with directions to the trial court to hold a Marsden hearing and to appoint new counsel for Armijo if the court concludes that the assistance rendered by his previous attorney was inadequate. We direct the court to reinstate the judgment, however, if it concludes otherwise following the Marsden hearing and thus declines to appoint new counsel, or if it appoints new counsel and that counsel either declines to file a motion to vacate Armijo\u2019s plea or the court denies any such motion that is filed.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA. The Charge and Special Allegations Against Armijo\nThis case arises out of an April 11, 2014 incident in which Armijo allegedly stabbed a man with a \u201cbayonet type knife.\u201d Following a preliminary hearing on July 29 and 30, 2014, the People filed an information charging Armijo with attempted willful, deliberate and premeditated murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664), and specially alleging he had personally used a deadly weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(3)). The information also specially alleged Armijo had suffered one prior serious or violent felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) and section 667, subdivision (a)(1). Armijo pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations at his August 13, 2014 arraignment.\nDeputy Public Defender Delia Metoyer represented Armijo at his preliminary hearing and arraignment, and then at nine pretrial conferences from September 4, 2014 through January 13, 2015. On January 5, 2015, Metoyer filed on Armijo\u2019s behalf a motion to set aside the information under section 995. A different deputy public defender, however, Diana Alexander, represented Armijo at a January 22, 2015 pretrial conference; Alexander informed the trial court that the case had been reassigned to her. The court granted Alexander\u2019s oral motion made on Armijo\u2019s behalf to continue the case to March 9, 2015.\nB. Armijo\u2019s Letter to the Trial Court Regarding Metoyer and Alexander\nAfter Alexander replaced Metoyer, Armijo sent a letter dated February 2, 2015 to the trial court. In the letter, Armijo expressed concerns about Metoyer\u2019s past handling of his defense and the prospect of being represented going forward by Alexander.\nTo begin with, Armijo stated that following the preliminary hearing, he asked Metoyer \u201cseveral questions about the direction of my case,\u201d but that Metoyer \u201cseemed to have difficulty making time to answer my questions or provide reasonable explanations in person or over the phone if she accepted my collect calls.\u201d Armijo further stated that during one phone conversation he asked Metoyer \u201cabout the progress being made by her investigator and she admitted she had not been in contact with him.\u201d Armijo described Metoyer as \u201cinexperienced and overwhelmed by her caseload and schedule demands.\u201d He also said that Metoyer had told him that she \u201chad a family emergency involving her grandparents\u201d and, as a result, she did not have time in December 2014 to file his section 995 motion. Armijo additionally complained that, after the motion was filed, Metoyer \u201cnever bothered to discuss it with me.\u201d\nArmijo also said in the letter that he learned on January 22, 2015 that \u201cMetoyer was no longer able to represent me and that my case would be continued for another 45 days\u201d to March 9, 2015. Referring to Alexander, Armijo stated that he was concerned that his case had been reassigned from Metoyer to \u201canother overwhelmed and inexperienced public defender.\u201d He thus requested that the court order a different state-appointed attorney to be assigned to his case to replace Metoyer and Alexander.\nThe clerk\u2019s office in the trial court received Armijo\u2019s letter and file stamped it on February 17, 2015.\nArmijo\u2019s next court date following the court\u2019s receipt of his letter was the March 9, 2015 pretrial conference that the court had set at Alexander\u2019s request. But at that conference, Deputy Public Defender Francine Logan, not Alexander, appeared on Armijo\u2019s behalf. Logan informed the court that she \u201cha[d] just been assigned [to the] case.\u201d She described the discovery as \u201cvoluminous\u201d and moved to continue the case to April 9, 2015. In granting that motion, the trial court told Armijo that he had been \u201cextremely patient,\u201d but that because Logan was newly assigned to the case, she \u201cneed[ed] additional time ... to prepare for [the] trial.\u201d There is no indication in the record that Logan was assigned to the case to replace Metoyer and/or Alexander as a result of any action that the trial court took in response to Armijo\u2019s February 2, 2015 letter requesting appointment of new counsel. The court did not a hold a hearing on the request or make any mention of it at the March 9, 2015 conference.\nC. Armijo\u2019s Letter to the Trial Court Regarding Logan\nOn April 9, 2015, a different deputy public defender stood in for Logan to represent Armijo that day and requested that the case be trailed to April 15, 2015; the trial court granted that request. On April 15, yet another deputy public defender stood in for Logan and requested that the case be trailed to April 21, 2015; the court granted that request as well. It is not clear from the record precisely why Logan was absent at the April 9 and 15 pretrial conferences.\nOn the heels of the April 15 pretrial conference, Armijo sent a second letter, dated April 16, 2015, to the trial court. In this letter, Armijo expressed concerns about Logan\u2019s handling of his defense.\nArmijo began by voicing his frustration over Logan\u2019s absences at the April 9 and 15 pretrial conferences and the resulting rescheduling of the conference. Next, Armijo catalogued complaints about Logan\u2019s representation of him dating back to the March 9, 2015 conference at which she first appeared on his behalf. In particular, Armijo stated that Logan had \u201cassured\u201d him on that date that \u201cshe had 17 years [of] experience and that she would remain in contact with me before my next court date. In fact, she indicated she would visit me in the county jail so that we could review my case. She never visited me, nor did she accept the numerous collect calls I made to the number on her business card. I also wrote her a letter reminding her that I was still waiting to meet with her at her convenience.\u201d Armijo added that he was concerned that the pending section 995 motion was deficient because it \u201cfocus[ed] on technicalities never mentioning the actual [prelintinary hearing] testimony,\u201d and that he wanted to discuss the motion with Logan, but she was unavailable for that.\nArmijo further noted that, since the inception of the case, he had been assigned \u201c[three] different public defenders\u201d; he opined that \u201cnot one of them has been reliable, dependable, or able to provide the quality legal representation required to be successful in my case.\u201d Armijo also stated that he was frustrated by the \u201cpattern of unwanted continuances\u201d that he thought would stop after Logan was assigned to his case, but that had persisted. Armijo concluded the letter by stating, \u201cIt is rather obvious that the public defender\u2019s [sic |. for whatever reasons, has not been able to adequately represent me, and for these reasons I am requesting that you assign my case to a state-appointed attorney.\u201d\nThe clerk\u2019s office in the trial court received Armijo\u2019s second letter and file stamped it on April 24, 2015. The court did not hold a hearing on Armijo\u2019s request in the letter for the discharge and replacement of Logan. The court made no mention of the letter in any of the subsequent proceedings in the case.\nD. Proceedings Subsequent to the Second Letter\n1. The Denial of Armijo\u2019s Section 995 Motion and the Filing of an Amended Information\nOn April 21, 2015, which was in between the date of Armijo\u2019s second letter and the date the clerk\u2019s office received it, the trial court held a pretrial conference. Logan represented Armijo. At the conference, the court set May 7, 2015 as the hearing date on Armijo\u2019s section 995 motion. Armijo failed to appear in court on May 7, however, and so the hearing was trailed to May 12.\nArmijo appeared at the hearing on May 12. Logan represented him and argued the section 995 motion, which the trial court denied.\nOn June 3, 2015, the People filed an amended information, which was identical in all respects to the initial information, except that it added an allegation that Armijo had inflicted great bodily injury in committing the offense with which he was charged. (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a).) Armijo again pleaded not guilty to the charge and denied the special allegations.\n2. Armijo\u2019s Negotiated Plea and Resulting Conviction\nOn June 23, 2015, Armijo appeared in the trial court with Logan. He entered a negotiated plea of no contest to attempted murder and admitted the great bodily injury and prior strike allegations. In accordance with the plea agreement that Armijo reached with the People, the court sentenced him to 13 years in state prison and dismissed the remaining special allegations. The court awarded Armijo presentence custody credits of 514 days and imposed statutory fines, fees, and assessments.\n3. Armijo\u2019s Notice of Appeal and Request for a Certificate of Probable Cause To Appeal\nOn August 5, 2015, Armijo filed a timely notice of appeal in which he stated that he intended to challenge the validity of his plea. Armijo also filed a request for a certificate of probable cause allowing him to make that challenge. In his request, he referred to the two letters he sent to the trial court complaining about the assistance he received from his public defenders and seeking the appointment of substitute counsel. Citing Marsden, Armijo indicated that the trial court had not afforded him the opportunity to explain the reasons for his request. He also listed numerous grievances against Logan. Among other things, he stated that she failed to discuss the section 995 motion with him; improperly induced him to accept the plea deal rather than considering possible trial strategies; and \u201cfailed to clearly and thoroughly explain [the] guilty plea.\u201d The trial court granted Armijo\u2019s request for a certificate of probable cause.\nDISCUSSION\nArmijo\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court committed reversible error under Marsden by failing to hold a hearing in response to his letters requesting the discharge of his public defenders and the appointment of replacement counsel. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Armijo is correct as to the second letter and therefore reverse the judgment of conviction.\nA. Governing Law\nIn Marsden, the California Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of criminal defendants to the assistance of court-appointed counsel if they cannot afford private counsel encompasses the right to have their court-appointed counsel discharged and replaced by another one when the \u201c \u2018 \u201cfailure to do so would substantially impair or deny the right\u201d \u2019 \u201d to assistance of counsel. (Marsden, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 123.) \u201c \u2018A defendant is entitled to [this] relief if the record clearly shows that the first appointed attorney is not providing adequate representation [citation] or that defendant and counsel have become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation is likely to result [citations].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Fierro (1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 204 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 821 P.2d 1302].)\n\u201c[A] proper and formal\u201d Marsden motion is not required\u2014the defendant need only clearly indicate to the trial court \u201cin some manner\u201d that he or she is requesting the discharge and replacement of the appointed counsel. (People v. Lucky (1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 281 & fn. 8 [247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052]; see People v. Reed (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1146 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 710] [defendant must \u201cput the trial court on notice\u201d of a desire to replace appointed counsel].) Direct correspondence with the trial court is an acceptable manner for the defendant to make the request. (See, e.g., People v. Lloyd (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 724, 729-730 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 105].) \u201c\nThe defendant\u2019s right under Marsden to seek the discharge and replacement of court-appointed counsel applies at all stages of a criminal proceeding. The request thus may be made before or after a defendant is convicted. (People v. Smith (1993) 6 Cal.4th 684, 694 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 863 P.2d 192].)\nMost critically for purposes of Armijo\u2019s case, once the defendant clearly indicates to the trial court a request for the discharge and replacement of appointed counsel, the court must hold a hearing to allow the defendant to explain the basis for the request. (People v. Sanchez (2011) 53 Cal.4th 80, 89-90 [133 Cal.Rptr.3d 564, 264 P.3d 349] (Sanchez); People v. Mendoza (2000) 24 Cal.4th 130, 156-157 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 6 P.3d 150]; People v. Lloyd, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at p. 731.) This hearing requirement stems from Marsden itself, which gave rise to the term of art \u201cMarsden hearing\u201d to describe the proceeding at which such requests are to be resolved. (Sanchez, at pp. 89-90.)\nIn elucidating the hearing requirement, the Supreme Court in Marsden began by noting that \u2018\u201cthe decision whether to permit a defendant to discharge his appointed counsel and substitute another attorney ... is within the discretion of the trial court, and a defendant has no absolute right to more than one appointed attorney.\u201d (Marsden, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 123.) The court admonished, however, \u2018\u201cthat the trial court cannot thoughtfully exercise its discretion . . . without listening to [the defendant\u2019s] reasons for requesting a change of attorneys. A trial judge is unable to intelligently deal with a defendant\u2019s request for substitution of attorneys unless he is cognizant of the grounds which prompted the request. The defendant may have knowledge of conduct and events relevant to the diligence and competence of his attorney which are not apparent to the trial judge from observations within the four corners of the courtroom.\u201d (Ibid.) The court stated that to ensure that the right to discharge and replace appointed counsel is meaningful, the defendant must \u2018\u201cbe given ample opportunity to explain and if possible to document the basis of his contention [beyond the] bare complaint[s]\u201d that counsel is not providing adequate assistance. (Id. at p. 125.) Denial of that opportunity, the court held, is legal error that compels reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction unless the record shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. (Id. at p. 126; see Sanchez, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 92.)\nB. The Tried Court Erred by Failing To Hold a Marsden Hearing in Response to Armijo\u2019s Request in His Second Letter for the Discharge and Replacement of His Court-appointed Attorney\nArmijo\u2019s two letters to the trial court triggered his right to a Marsden hearing. Although his letters were not formal Marsden motions, Armijo clearly indicated in them that he sought the discharge of the public defenders who were representing him and their replacement by another court-appointed counsel.\nTechnically, Armijo\u2019s request in his first letter was rendered moot when Logan replaced Metoyer and Alexander as Armijo\u2019s attorney. Although the record does not indicate that this switch came about as the result of any action by the trial court, Armijo got what he wanted in the first letter\u2014a new lawyer. That still leaves the second letter, however. And in it, Armijo asked the trial court to replace Logan with another court-appointed counsel. The trial court failed to hold a hearing on that request. Perhaps Armijo would have been unable to show (as Marsden requires) that Logan had provided inadequate representation or that he had become embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict with Logan that ineffective representation was likely to result. But Armijo was entitled to the opportunity to try to make that showing at a Marsden hearing. The trial court erred in denying Armijo that opportunity.\nThe People\u2019s counterarguments are unavailing. First, citing People v. Lovings (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1305 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 710] and People v. Lobaugh (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 780 [233 Cal.Rptr. 683], the People assert that Armijo forfeited his Marsden rights by entering a no contest plea. Lovings and Lobaugh are inapposite. In both of those cases, the defendants were given the opportunity to present Marsden motions at Marsden hearings. Following the hearings, the trial courts denied the motions; subsequently, the defendants entered guilty pleas and were convicted. (Lovings, at pp. 1307-1309; Lobaugh, at p. 783.) The appellate courts held that the defendants\u2019 pleas waived their right to challenge the denial of their Marsden motions. (Lovings, at p. 1311; Lobaugh, at p. 786.)\nHere, by contrast, Armijo had no Marsden hearing in the first place. Unlike the defendants in Lovings and Lobaugh, Armijo is not challenging a preplea denial of a Marsden motion; he is challenging a preplea denial of a Marsden hearing. Armijo\u2019s case is thus akin to Sanchez, supra, 53 Cal.4th 80. The defendant there entered a guilty plea. At his sentencing hearing a month later, however, the defendant sought to vacate his plea and requested, through an informal Marsden motion, the discharge of his court-appointed attorney and replacement by another on the ground that the attorney had provided ineffective assistance in connection with the plea. (Sanchez, at pp. 84-85.) The trial court declined to conduct a Marsden hearing. The Supreme Court held that the failure to do so was reversible error. (Sanchez, at pp. 84, 92.) There was no suggestion in Sanchez that the defendant\u2019s plea forfeited his right to a Marsden hearing. Armijo\u2019s plea did not forfeit his right to a Marsden hearing either.\nSecond, the People contend that Armijo\u2019s second letter \u201cdid not make a clear request for substitute counsel\u201d and thus \u201cno Marsden inquiry by the trial court was required.\u201d This is incorrect. Armijo stated unequivocally in the second letter, \u201cI am requesting that you assign my case to a state-appointed attorney.\u201d We are not sure what more the People believe Armijo should have said to trigger his right to a Marsden hearing.\nThird, citing People v. Freeman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 450 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249] and People v. Wharton (1991) 53 Cal.3d 522 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290], the People contend that if Armijo\u2019s second letter is deemed a request for substitute counsel, it obviated the need for a Marsden hearing because the letter set forth the basis of his dissatisfaction with Logan in \u201c \u2018sufficient detail.\u2019 \u201d Freeman and Wharton have no bearing here. In both of those cases, the trial courts duly considered the defendants\u2019 detailed recitation of complaints about their court-appointed attorneys and, based on that review, denied the defendants\u2019 requests for the appointment of substitute counsel without holding a \u201c \u2018full-blown [Marsden] hearing.\u2019 \u201d (Freeman, at p. 481; see Wharton, at p. 580.) Here, by contrast, there is no evidence in the record that the trial court ever considered Armijo\u2019s complaints about Logan in the second letter or that the court even looked at the letter. Thus, whether Armijo\u2019s letter was sufficiently detailed within the meaning of Freeman and Wharton to excuse the need for a Marsden hearing is irrelevant.\nEqually misplaced is the People\u2019s assertion that Armijo\u2019s tactical disagreements with Logan that he outlined in the second letter are not grounds for replacement of court-appointed counsel under Marsden. In cases that so hold, the trial courts held Marsden hearings and considered the defendants\u2019 complaints about their counsel. (E.g., People v. Streeter (2012) 54 Cal.4th 205, 228-231 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 481, 278 P.3d 754].) That did not happen here. In any event, Armijo\u2019s objections went beyond tactical disagreements with Logan; he also charged that Logan was unavailable and failed to keep in touch with him.\nFinally, we are not persuaded by the People\u2019s argument that Armijo abandoned his Marsden request because he failed to assert it at the April 21, 2015 pretrial conference, five days after he transmitted the second letter. Abandonment of a Marsden request has been found where the defendant affirmatively withdrew it (People v. Padilla (1995) 11 Cal.4th 891, 927 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 426, 906 P.2d 388], overruled on other grounds in People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 823, fn. 1 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673]), and where the defendant failed to take advantage of the opportunity to present additional reasons for his request for new counsel at a second Marsden hearing after being afforded the opportunity to explain his request at an initial Marsden hearing (People v. Vera (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 970, 976-977, 981-982 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 896]). Nothing like that happened here: Armijo never withdrew his Marsden request, and he never had the opportunity to explain the request at a second Marsden hearing, let alone a first.\nIn People v. Jones (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 355, 362 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 905], the Fourth District Court of Appeal held that the defendant abandoned his Marsden request after he sought or stipulated to several continuances for a Marsden hearing but then proceeded to trial without reminding the trial court of the pending Marsden request. Nothing like that happened here either; no Marsden hearing ever was scheduled and then continued.\nIn finding abandonment in Jones, the Court of Appeal invoked the principle that a criminal defendant may be deemed to have abandoned a right by failing to press for a hearing on that right or by acquiescing in the trial court\u2019s inadvertent failure to hold a hearing. (People v. Jones, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at p. 361, quoting People v. Braxton (2004) 34 Cal.4th 798, 813-814 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 46, 101 P.3d 994].) Here, Armijo did not press for a Marsden hearing at the April 21 pretrial conference (or at subsequent proceedings) and, from the record, it appears that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold the hearing was inadvertent. Nevertheless, for two reasons, we decline to apply the principle on which Jones relied. For one, in Jones, the defendant\u2019s counsel was fully aware of the Marsden request. Indeed, counsel sought a number of the continuances of the Marsden hearing that the trial court granted. The failure to press for the Marsden hearing or remind the court about it thus lies largely with the defendant\u2019s counsel. Here, by contrast, there is no indication from the record that Logan knew that Armijo had written to the trial court about her and was seeking substitute counsel. Additionally, it seems quite possible that Armijo did not raise the Marsden issue at the April 21, 2015 pretrial conference out of a mistaken belief that the court already had received his second letter (it was not received until Apr. 24) and denied the request he made therein to discharge Logan, which may have suggested to Armijo that it would have been futile to ask the court at that point to appoint new counsel. (See People v. Abbaszadeh (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 642, 648 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 873] [discussing futility exception to abandonment rule].) Under these circumstances, we do not believe that the fault for the trial court\u2019s failure to hold a Marsden hearing should rest with Armijo. Therefore, we decline to find that Armijo abandoned his Marsden request through a failure to press for a hearing on the request or acquiescence to the court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing.\nC. The Trial Court\u2019s Error in Failing To Hold a Marsden Hearing Was Not Harmless Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nBased on our review of the record, it is possible that Armijo may not have been able to show at a Marsden hearing either the inadequacy of representation by Logan or an irreconcilable conflict with her. However, because the record largely is limited to Armijo\u2019s complaint letters, we do not know what other evidence Armijo could have offered had he been afforded a Marsden hearing. It is conceivable that he could have provided at the hearing \u201cknowledge of conduct and events relevant to the diligence and competence of his attorney[s] which are not apparent\u201d from the \u201cbare complaint[s]\u201d and that would have tipped the balance in favor of appointment of substitute counsel. (Marsden, supra, 2 Cal.3d at pp. 123, 125.) Under these circumstances, we \u201ccannot speculate upon the basis of a silent record that the trial court, after listening to defendant\u2019s reasons, would decide the appointment of new counsel was unnecessary.\u201d (People v. Winbush (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 987, 991 [252 Cal.Rptr. 722].) Thus, the trial court\u2019s error in failing to hold a Marsden hearing in response to Armijo\u2019s letter about Logan cannot be treated as harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nBecause of the potential that Armijo could demonstrate inadequate representation or an irreconcilable conflict at a Marsden hearing, we conditionally reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court with instructions to hold a Marsden hearing. If the trial court finds after the hearing that Armijo demonstrated ineffective assistance or an irreconcilable conflict, the court shall appoint new counsel to assist Armijo in filing a motion to withdraw his plea or any other such motions newly appointed counsel may deem appropriate. However, the trial court shall reinstate the judgment if (1) the court finds after the Marsden hearing that Armijo failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance or an irreconcilable conflict, or (2) the court grants Armijo\u2019s request for substitute appointed counsel, but either substitute counsel declines to file a motion to withdraw the plea or other appropriate motion, or the court denies any such motion.\nDISPOSITION\nThe judgment is conditionally reversed and the case is remanded with directions to the trial court to hold a Marsden hearing, and, if Armijo\u2019s request for substitute appointed counsel is granted, to appoint new counsel to assist Armijo and to entertain such motions as newly appointed counsel may file. The court shall reinstate the judgment if (1) Armijo\u2019s request is denied, or (2) the request is granted but substitute counsel declines to file a motion to withdraw the plea or other appropriate motion, or the court denies any such motion.\nZelon, Acting P. J., and Segal, J., concurred.\nJudge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.\nUnless otherwise stated, all further statutory references herein are to the Penal Code.\nArmijo indicated in the letter that he was told that Logan missed the April 9 conference due to illness. The letter offered no explanation for her absence from the April 15 conference.\nIt is unclear from the record whether the trial court judge personally saw Armijo\u2019s letters. Even if the judge did not see them, this would \u201cnot justify the court\u2019s failure to conduct [a Marsden] hearing\u201d because it was incumbent on the clerk\u2019s office, which file stamped the letters, to bring them to the judge\u2019s attention. (People v. Lloyd, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at p. 731 & fn. 7.)\nPeople v. Eastman (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 688 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 922] is in the same vein as Sanchez. The Com! of Appeal in Eastman held the trial court erred in failing to hold a Marsden hearing upon receipt at the sentencing healing of the defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea and discharge and replace his court-appointed attorney who had advised him to enter the plea. (Eastman, at pp. 695-696.) As in Sanchez, there was no hint in Eastman that the defendant\u2019s plea forfeited his right to a Marsden hearing.\nSeizing on Armijo\u2019s statement in the second letter that he was \u201cstill without an attorney,\u201d the People assert that Armijo apparently was of the view that Logan no longer was representing him as of the date of the letter and, therefore, the letter did not trigger a right to a Marsden hearing on the replacement of an existing court-appointed attorney with another. The People read too much into Armijo\u2019s statement. Taken as a whole, the letter indicates that Armijo was aware that Logan still was representing him and that the new attorney whose appointment he was seeking would replace Logan. Armijo\u2019s statement that he was \u201cstill without an attorney\u201d may simply have been a rhetorical device to call the court\u2019s attention to his frustration stemming from Logan\u2019s absences at the April 9, 2015 hearing, and then again at the April 15, 2015 hearing, which was the day before he transmitted the second letter.\nOur instructions to the trial court on remand are drawn from Sanchez, supra. 53 Cal.4th at page 92. That case delineates what is to happen on remand following a reversal of a plea-based conviction on account of the trial court\u2019s failure to hold a Marsden healing. Consistent with Sanchez, our instructions reflect a \u201cconditional reversal\u201d that contemplates the possible reinstatement of the judgment and conviction. (People v.

Part of the income from the fee is used to support student groups that pursue political and ideological causes. The student plaintiffs in this case object both to the imposition of the fee and to the manner in which it is used.\nWe reject plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the imposition of the fee. The authority to levy a student activities fee is well within the broad powers of self-governance that the citizens of California have granted the University\u2019s Regents under the state Constitution.\nThe Regents\u2019 freedom to govern the University, however, is not the only freedom at stake in this case. Also at stake is the freedom of students not to be compelled and coerced to subsidize political and ideological causes. The dissenting opinion misleadingly asserts that this case is about the \u201cdissemination of controversial ideas\u201d (dis. opn. of Arabian, J., post, at p. 869) and wrongly accus.es the majority of somehow restricting speech. In fact, the case has nothing to do with restrictions on speech. It goes without saying that all students are free to organize, to promote their ideas, and to seek by all legal means to persuade others that their views are correct. Moreover, the Regents may continue to fund student political activities through the fees of students who do not object. However, the constitutional guaranties of free speech and association do not permit the state to make speech a matter of compulsion and coercion. As the present system of funding student activities has that effect, it cannot be continued without affording dissenting students an appropriate remedy.\nAt the heart of the dissenting opinion is a frank proposal to sacrifice students\u2019 constitutional right not to be compelled to support political causes in order to teach them about the \u201cfundamental republican virtues upon which this nation was founded.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Arabian, J\u201e post, at p. 870.) The irony of that proposal speaks for itself.\nI. Facts and Procedural History\nPlaintiffs in this action were students at the University of California at Berkeley (University), or taxpayers, during 1981. Defendants are the Regents of the University of California (Regents), the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), and various officers of the University. The Regents govern the University pursuant to authority granted by the state Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9.) The ASUC is the organization authorized by the Regents to administer student government and student extracurricular affairs.\nSince 1955, every student at the University has paid a mandatory, nonrefundable fee to support the ASUC each academic period as a condition of enrollment. For many years, payment of the fee entailed automatic membership in the ASUC. Shortly after this litigation began, however, the University changed its procedures to permit each student to accept or to decline ASUC membership. Payment of the fee remains mandatory.\nThe Regents transfer most of the income from the mandatory fee to the ASUC. In 1982, when this case was tried, the amount of the fee was $12.50 per student per quarter. The total amount collected from students and transferred by the Regents to the ASUC in the 1981-1982 academic year was $607,635. The ASUC\u2019s total expenditures for the same period were $1,016,569. The difference between the income from the mandatory fee and the ASUC\u2019s total expenditures is attributable to the ASUC\u2019s many business enterprises, which include the Student Union Building, a bookstore, and a ski lodge. In its operations the ASUC employs a full-time staff of over 85 persons and a part-time staff of over 250.\nThe ASUC uses its income, including the proceeds of the mandatory fee, to support a wide variety of activities in addition to student government. The ASUC is, for example, active in politics through the ASUC Senate, the governing body of 30 elected student representatives. Besides administering student affairs, the ASUC Senate debates and passes resolutions on local, state, and national issues. Issues on which the ASUC Senate has taken positions include, for example, gay and lesbian rights, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, gun control, the reelection of a particular United States Representative, a municipal initiative to legalize marijuana, and the treatment of political prisoners in foreign countries.\nThe ASUC also subsidizes lobbying by two affiliated groups, the University of California Lobby and the ASUC Municipal Lobby. These groups seek to influence legislation pending before the state and municipal governments, respectively. Through the former, the ASUC has lobbied the state Legislature in favor of using registration fees to fund abortions, against rent discrimination, against budget cuts for the University, and in favor of mandatory student fees. Through the latter, the ASUC has lobbied the City of Berkeley on a nuclear freeze initiative, public transportation fares, city investment policy, zoning, and rent control, and has endorsed student candidates for municipal office.\nIn addition to its own activities, the ASUC also uses income from mandatory fees to subsidize approximately 150 student activity groups. Any four students at the University may form such a group and register it with the University. All registered groups may, but need not, request funding from the ASUC. Student groups pursue diverse interests, including academic subjects, culture, sports, games, and politics. To obtain funding, a student group submits a budget to the ASUC Finance Committee for review, which forwards its recommendation to the ASUC Senate for approval. Upon approval, a student group is eligible to receive reimbursement for actual expenses as incurred. The ASUC\u2019s rules permit reimbursement for 11 categories of expenses: \u201c(1) personal services, (2) stationery and supplies, (3) telephone, (4) travel, (5) dues and subscriptions, (6) postage, (7) equipment rental, (8) advertising, (9) programs and printing, (10) facilities rental, and (11) other.\u201d\nMost of the registered student groups are devoted to academic, cultural, or recreational pursuits. The Physics Students Society, the Spanish Club, the Cal Ski Club, and the Chess Club are random, typical examples. However, other groups pursue frankly political or ideological goals. At trial, plaintiffs objected to the ASUC\u2019s funding of 14 such groups: Amnesty International; Berkeley Students for Peace; Campus N.O.W. (National Organization for Women); Campus Abortion Rights Action League; Gay and Lesbian League; Progressive Student Organization; REAP (Radical Education and Action Project); Spartacus Youth League; Students Against Intervention in El Salvador; Students for Economic Democracy; UC Berkeley Feminist Alliance and Women Organized Against Sexual Harassment; UC Sierra Club; Conservation and Natural Resources Organization; and Greenpeace Berkeley. Some of these organizations are affiliated with state, national, or international organizations.\nThe procedural history of this action, insofar as it relates to the issues before us, is as follows: On April 16, 1979, plaintiffs Averell Smith, Marina Trepetin, Arlo Hale Smith, and Adlai Smith filed suit in the Superior Court of Alameda County against the Regents, the ASUC, and certain individual officers of the University. In their action, plaintiffs challenged the Regents\u2019 collection and use of the mandatory fee as violating the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, article I, section 2, subdivision (a), article I, section 3, and article IX, section 9, subdivision (f), of the California Constitution, and various other state constitutional and statutory provisions. Plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and all other appropriate relief. On May 23, 1980, five additional student plaintiffs (Brad Sparks, Jimmy Horn, Emily Taylor, Alexa Smith, and Thomas Kistler) filed individual actions in the Berkeley-Albany Small Claims Court seeking refunds of mandatory fees. All actions were subsequently consolidated by stipulation in the superior court.\nOn March 25, 1982, the superior court summarily adjudicated that the Regents\u2019 collection of the mandatory fee was legal. The court then tried, without a jury, plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the use of the fee. The court expressly found that \u201cthere ha[d] been isolated instances in the past wherein University and ASUC Rule[s] and Regulations ha[d] been violated in areas involving partisan political activities, ballot measure positions and alleged misuse of [the] University[\u2019s] name in connection with student activities . . . .\u201d Nevertheless, the court entered judgment for defendants. The Court of Appeal affirmed. We granted review and deferred briefing pending the United States Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of Keller v. State Bar of California (1990) 496 U.S. 1 [110 L.Ed.2d 1, 110 S.Ct. 2228], which involved a challenge to the State Bar of California\u2019s use of mandatory dues to support political and ideological activities. We then remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the high court\u2019s opinion. When the Court of Appeal once again affirmed, we granted review.\nII. Discussion\nA. Collection of the Mandatory Fee.\nPlaintiffs Kistler and Taylor contend that the Regents do not have sufficient authority to collect a mandatory student activities fee. The contention lacks merit. The California Constitution expressly invests the Regents with \u201cfull powers of organization and government\u201d over the University. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9, subd. (a).) This general grant of power, which has been described as giving the Regents \u201cvirtual autonomy in self-governance\u201d (Regents of University of California v. City of Santa Monica (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 130, 135 [143 Cal.Rptr. 276]), is plainly adequate to permit the Regents to levy a student activities fee in the absence of a constitutional or statutory prohibition.\nPlaintiffs suggest that language with the effect of prohibiting the collection of a mandatory fee can be found in several authorities, namely, article IX, section 9, subdivision (f), of the state Constitution; section 13 of the Organic Act establishing the University (Stats. 1867-1868, ch. CCXLIV, \u00a7 13, pp. 253-254); and our decision in Stanson v. Mott (1976) 17 Cal.3d 206, 213-223 [130 Cal.Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1]. The constitutional and statutory provisions just cited declare, in essence, that the University shall be kept free of political and sectarian influence. Stanson v. Mott, supra, held that a state official acted improperly by spending public funds to campaign in favor of a ballot proposition. While these authorities might support an argument against some of the uses to which the fee has been put, they do not appear to affect the Regents\u2019 power to collect a fee, assuming its use is proper.\nWe thus turn to plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the use of the fee.\nB. ASUC Support of Political and Ideological Groups.\nPlaintiffs contend that the ASUC uses income from the mandatory fee in several ways that violate their rights to freedom of speech and association. We consider first the use of such fees to subsidize student groups devoted to political and ideological causes.\nThis case involves two important principles. (3) The first is that the government may not compel a person to contribute money to support political or ideological causes. (See, e.g., Keller v. State Bar of California, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 9-10 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 11-12] (Keller); Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977) 431 U.S. 209, 234-235 [52 L.Ed.2d 261, 283-285, 97 S.Ct. 1782] (Abood).) Such contributions are a form of speech, and compelled speech offends the First Amendment, just as do restrictions on speech. (E.g., Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 9-10 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 11-12]; Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 234-235, & 235 fn. 31 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 283-285]; Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974) 418 U.S. 241, 247-258 [41 L.Ed.2d 730, 735-741, 94 S.Ct. 2831] [state may not compel a newspaper to print a political candidate\u2019s reply to an editorial]; Torcaso v. Watkins (1961) 367 U.S. 488, 489-496 [6 L.Ed.2d 982, 983-988, 81 S.Ct. 1680] [state may not compel civil servants to affirm a belief in God]; Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) 319 U.S. 624, 630-642 [87 L.Ed. 1628, 1633-1640, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674] [state may not compel students to salute the flag].) Courts have often stressed this principle by repeating Thomas Jefferson\u2019s view that \u201c1 \u201cto compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.\" \u2019 \u2019\u2019 (Brant, James Madison: The Nationalist (1948) p. 354, as quoted in Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 235, fn. 31 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 284]; see also Keller, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 10 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 11-12], and Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson (1986) 475 U.S. 292, 305, fn. 15 [89 L.Ed.2d 232, 246, 106 S.Ct. 1066] (Hudson).)\nThe second principle is that the Regents, to be effective, must have considerable discretion to determine how best to carry out the University\u2019s educational mission. Indeed, we have said that \u201cthe power of the Regents to operate, control, and administer the University is virtually exclusive.\u201d (Regents of University of California v. Superior Court (1970) 3 Cal.3d 529, 540 [91 Cal.Rptr. 57, 476 P.2d 457], internal quotation marks omitted; see also San Francisco Labor Council v. Regents of University of California (1980) 26 Cal.3d 785, 788 [163 Cal.Rptr. 460, 608 P.2d 277].)\nThese principles conflict in the case before us. Plaintiffs, invoking their constitutional right not to be compelled to speak, argue that the use of mandatory fees to subsidize student political groups impermissibly burdens that right. The Regents, relying on their authority to define the University\u2019s educational mission, acknowledge the burden on plaintiffs\u2019 rights but argue that student political activity offers educational benefits that justify the burden.\nOur analysis begins with a line of high court decisions that arose in the context of agency-shop agreements. Under these decisions, a state may compel employees who obtain the benefits of a union\u2019s collective bargaining efforts to pay service fees to the union, even though such employees may choose not to join. (Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 217-223 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 272-277]; see also Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. at p. 301 [89 L.Ed.2d at pp. 243-244].) The court has explained this result as justified by the state\u2019s interest in facilitating collective bargaining and preventing \u201cfree riders.\u201d (Abood, supra, 431 U.S. p. 222 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 275-276]; see also id., at pp. 220-221 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 274-275].) However, the constitutional prohibition against compelled speech limits the uses to which a mandatory fee may be put: When the state does compel nonmembers to support a union financially, the nonmembers may prevent the union from using their contributions to fund the expression of political and ideological views unrelated to collective bargaining. (Id., at p. 234 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 283-284]; see also Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. at pp. 301-302 [89 L.Ed.2d at pp. 243-244].)\nBecause the use of a mandatory fee implicates freedom of association, strict scrutiny applies. As the high court reiterated in Hudson, supra, \u201c[infringements on freedom of association \u2018may be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\u2019 \u201d (475 U.S. at p. 303, fn. 11 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 245], quoting Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609, 623 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 104 S.Ct. 3244].) Thus, even when the government has a sufficiently compelling interest to require a person to subsidize an organization against his or her will, the resulting burden on freedom of association \u201crequires that the procedure be carefully tailored to minimize the infringement.\u201d (Hudson, supra, 415 U.S. at p. 303 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 245].)\nThe principle that underlies the agency-shop decisions took sharper focus in Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, which concerned the mandatory payment of dues by lawyers to a bar association. The plaintiff lawyers objected to the bar\u2019s use of dues to fund lobbying on issues of general social concern that had little, if anything, to do with the practice of law, such as gun control, abortion, and prayer in public schools. The bar defended its lobbying as a permissible exercise of its statutory authority to \u201caid in all matters pertaining to the advancement of the science of jurisprudence or to the improvement of the administration of justice.\u201d (Id., at p. 15 [110 L.Ed..2d at p. 15], internal quotation marks omitted.)\nThe high court rejected the bar\u2019s argument. In so doing, the court made clear that the use of mandatory contributions must be \u201cgermane,\u201d not simply to any purpose the organization chooses to declare for itself, but \u201cto the purpose for which compelled association was justified\u201d as a matter of constitutional law. (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 13 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14], citing Abood, supra, 431 U.S. 209; see Abood, supra, at pp. 219, 235 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 273-274, 284-285].) In other words, the existence of a compelling interest sometimes permits the state to require a person to associate with an organization, or to support it financially, despite the general constitutional prohibition against laws with that effect. However, that one\u2019s support may be compelled for some purposes does not mean that one must also subsidize every activity the organization in question chooses to undertake.\nTo illustrate, the state interests that justified compulsory bar membership in Keller were the specific goals of regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services. (496 U.S. at p. 13 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 13-14].) As the high court explained, \u201c[t]he State Bar may therefore constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals out of the mandatory dues of all members. It may not, however, in such manner fund activities of an ideological nature which fall outside of those areas of activity.\u201d (Id., at p. 14 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14].) Thus, the high court rejected the State Bar\u2019s argument that its lobbying on matters of general social interest, for example, \u201cto advance a gun control or a nuclear weapons freeze initiative,\u201d could be justified as germane to the Bar\u2019s broader goal of improving the administration of justice. (Id., at pp. 14-16 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp.14-16].)\nTo summarize, Keller and Abood teach that the state may compel a person to support an organization if there is a sufficiently compelling reason to do so, and that the organization\u2019s use of mandatory contributions must be germane to the purposes that justified the requirement of support. (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 13-14]; Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 217-223, 232-237 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 272-277, 282-286].) The Regents argue that their use of mandatory fees to support student political groups satisfies these principles. They reason that the University\u2019s purpose is to educate, and that the funding of such groups by the ASUC provides educational opportunities. Participation in such groups, according to the Regents, gives students a chance \u201cto express their views on campus, to participate in campus administrative positions, to provide self-education in government processes, to develop social skills, to inform the student body about a variety of issues, and to ensure freedom of expression and association.\u201d\nWhile Keller and Abood hold that activities supported by mandatory contributions must be \u201cgermane\u201d to the constitutionally relevant function, it does not follow, as the Regents argue, that everything \u201cgermane\u201d is automatically permissible without the need for further inquiry. Keller and Abood involved much lighter burdens on speech and associational rights than those at issue here. A state bar\u2019s regulatory function, as in Keller, and a labor union\u2019s collective bargaining function, as in Abood, can be narrowly defined. Thus, to be compelled to pay for activities \u201cgermane\u201d to those functions does not substantially burden an unwilling supporter\u2019s speech and associational rights. While the unwilling supporter may receive unwanted professional or economic assistance, he or she remains free not to speak or to support others\u2019 speech on political and ideological issues. In contrast, the University\u2019s educational function is extremely broad; it potentially encompasses all of life. By recognizing that student political activity can be \u201cgermane\u201d to education we run the risk of sanctioning a much greater burden on speech and associational rights than the high court necessarily contemplated when it used that term. (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 14-16], citing Abood, supra, 431 U.S. 209; see also Abood, supra, at pp. 219, 235 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 273-274, 284-285].)\nThe solution to this problem is to set a rational limit on the use of mandatory fees. We can do this by recognizing what is obviously true, namely, that a group\u2019s dedication to achieving its political or ideological goals, at some point, begins to outweigh any legitimate claim it may have to be educating students on the University\u2019s behalf. To fund such a group through mandatory fees will usually constitute more of a burden on dissenting students\u2019 speech and associational rights than is necessary to achieve any significant educational goal. The University can teach civics in other ways that involve a lesser burden on those rights, or no burden at all.\nIndeed, this is the approach that courts have followed in the two cases that are fairly closely on point. (Carroll v. Blinken (2d Cir. 1992) 957 F.2d 991, cert. den. (1992) _ U.S. _ [121 L.Ed.2d 224, 113 S.Ct. 300]; Galda v. Rutgers (3d Cir. 1985) 772 F.2d 1060, cert. den. (1986) 475 U.S. 1065 [89 L.Ed.2d 602, 106 S.Ct. 1375].)\nIn Carroll v. Blinken, supra, 957 F.2d 991 (Carroll), students at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany challenged the use of a portion of their mandatory student activity fee to fund the New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc. (NYPIRG). NYPIRG, a statewide organization with chapters on 19 SUNY campuses, described itself as a \u201c \u2018nonpartisan research and advocacy organization directed by New York State college and university students.\u2019 \u201d (Id., at pp. 993-994.) NYPIRG spent money both on and off campus. On campus, NYPIRG financed research projects by students and sponsored debates, symposiums, and professors\u2019 fora on issues of public interest. Off campus, NYPIRG employed 60 full-time professional staff members to lobby the state government on issues of \u201c \u2018consumer protection, government and corporate accountability and economic and social justice.\u2019 \u201d (Id., at p. 994.)\nThe court in Carroll identified the limits of mandatory funding by balancing the educational benefits that NYPIRG offered to students against the infringement of the dissenting students\u2019 right not to be compelled to subsidize NYPIRG\u2019s political activities. The court frankly recognized the infringement. To quote the opinion, the dissenting students\u2019 \u201cright to be free from compelled speech suffers when NYPIRG uses student funds to raise issues on campus, organize the community and lobby the legislature in pursuit of \u2018economic and social justice.\u2019 \u201d (957 F.2d at p. 999.) The court also recognized that these intrusions must be \u201c \u2018narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary intrusion on freedom of expression\u2019 \u201d and justified by the state. (Ibid., quoting Schad v. Mount Ephraim (1981) 452 U.S. 61, 69 fn. 7 [68 L.Ed.2d 671, 681, 101 S.Ct. 2176].) However, the court found that NYPIRG offered benefits on campus that were \u201csubstantial enough to justify the infringement . . . .\u201d (Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 1001.) These benefits consisted of promoting extracurricular life, transmitting skills and civic duty, and stimulating energetic campus debate. (Ibid.)\nThe Carroll court reached a different conclusion regarding NYPIRG\u2019s off-campus activities. Reasoning, as before, that \u201ceven incidental burdens on speech [must] be \u2018narrowly drawn\u2019 \u201d (957 F.2d at p. 1002, quoting Schad v. Mt. Ephraim, supra, 452 U.S. at p. 69, fn. 7 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 681]; cf. Carroll, supra, at p. 999), the court concluded that the purported educational benefits \u201cvanish when NYPIRG money is spent in the halls of the state legislature . . . .\u201d (Id., at p. 1002.) The university\u2019s interests, the court reasoned, \u201care still, after all, those of the university and its community, not that of an independent statewide organization.\u201d (Ibid.)\nThere is language in Carroll that the Regents interpret as suggesting that the standard of review in cases such as this is more relaxed than the strict scrutiny standard that courts typically apply in cases involving burdens on speech and associational rights. However, we do not read the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion that way. The court wrote, citing United States v. Albertini (1985) 472 U.S. 675 [86 L.Ed.2d 536, 105 S.Ct. 2897] (Albertini), that it would \u201clook to see whether the [challenged] regulation \u2018promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d (Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 999, quoting Albertini, supra, 472 U.S. at p. 689 [86 L.Ed.2d at p. 548].) In context, however, it is clear that the high court in Albertini did not use this language to announce a relaxed standard of review. In that case the Court upheld, as applied to a person protesting nuclear weapons, a law making it a criminal offense to reenter a military base after having been ordered not to do so by the commander. The high court did use the language quoted in Carroll, but the Court also emphasized that even \u201can incidental burden on speech [must be] no greater than is essential. . . .\u201d (Albertini, supra, 472 U.S. at p. 689 [86 L.Ed.2d at p. 548].) Reading the quoted language in context, it is evident that the high court merely applied a version of the strict scrutiny test that courts traditionally apply in symbolic conduct cases.\nWhatever the import of the Carroll court\u2019s reference to Albertini may be, what matters for our purposes is this: The Second Circuit expressly and repeatedly recognized that the defendants had to show that SUNY\u2019s mandatory funding rule was \u201c \u2018narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary intrusion\u2019 \u201d on constitutional rights. (Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at pp. 999, 1002, quoting Schad v. Mt. Ephraim, supra, 452 U.S. at p. 69, fn. 7 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 681].) This, in essence, is strict scrutiny, the same standard that the high court invoked in Hudson (supra, 475 U.S. at p. 303, fn. 11 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 245]).\nIn Galda v. Rutgers, supra, 772 F.2d 1060 (Galda), the court applied the same test to a similar organization but reached a different conclusion. The student plaintiffs at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, objected to the use of a mandatory fee to support the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group (New Jersey PIRG). New Jersey PIRG, like the organization involved in Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d 991, was a statewide organization with student members on many campuses. New Jersey PIRG lobbied the federal and state governments on various matters of social interest, including the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, nuclear weapons, and the environment. New Jersey PIRG also provided internships for students, who received academic credit on campus for the work they performed. (772 F.2d at p. 1061.)\nThe court in Galda considered it important that New Jersey PIRG was a statewide organization rather than one consisting solely of Rutgers students. The court also attributed significance to the particular funding mechanism employed: Students voted periodically to support New Jersey PIRG through a separate, mandatory fee rather than through the general student activities fund. For these reasons, the court felt that it was unnecessary to \u201caddress the problem presented by a state university\u2019s allocation of a mandatory nonrefundable student activity fee\u201d or the question whether \u201can organization with PIRG\u2019s philosophic outlook may be funded though the general activities fund as are other campus organizations representing diverse views.\u201d (772 F.2d at p. 1064.)\nThe particular facts of the Galda case undoubtedly determined its outcome, but there is nothing in the Third Circuit\u2019s approach that prevents its application to on-campus student groups. In essence, the court inquired whether mandatory funding of New Jersey PIRG was necessary to achieve the university\u2019s educational goals and weighed the purported educational benefits against the burden on constitutional rights to determine whether the burden was justified. (Galda, supra, 772 F.2d at pp. 1065-1068.) This, of course, is the same approach that the Second Circuit took in Carroll (supra, 957 F.2d at pp. 1001-1002).\nFollowing this approach, the Galda court accepted the university\u2019s argument that participation in New Jersey PIRG offered educational benefits to students. However, the court determined that the educational benefits offered by New Jersey PIRG were not sufficient to justify the infringement of dissenting students\u2019 speech and associational rights. The court reasoned as follows: \u201cAlthough the training PIRG members may receive is considerable, there can be no doubt that it is secondary to PIRG\u2019s stated objectives of a frankly ideological bent. To that extent the educational benefits are only \u2018incidental\u2019\u2014arising from or accompanying the principal objectives\u2014and subordinate to the group\u2019s function of promoting its political and ideological aims.\u201d (772 F.2d at p. 1065.)\nWhile there is language in Galda suggesting that the mandatory funding of political groups might be acceptable if accomplished through a content-neutral process in which all groups on campus were free to compete (772 F.2d at p. 1067), the opinion did not purport to announce such a holding. Moreover, other language in the opinion cogently demonstrates why a content-neutral funding process, standing alone, cannot sufficiently protect the rights of students who do not wish to subsidize other students\u2019 political activity. To quote the Galda opinion, \u201ceven if the opponents succeed in achieving mandatory contributions for their own organization, they are not relieved from the obligation to pay a fee to a group with which they disagree. For example, if the university compelled a student to make separate contributions to both the Democratic and Republican National Committees, the evil is not undone; it is compounded. Adherents to each party would be forced to pay a fee to the other political group, a clearly unconstitutional exaction.\u201d (Ibid.) The Second Circuit made the same point in Carroll, supra: \u201cThe fact that appellants\u2019 student activity fee will also compel them to speak through a number of other campus groups in addition to NYPIRG in no way heals the constitutional infirmity; it simply means that students must fund more than one unwanted view.\u201d (957 F.2d at p. 998, citing Galda, supra, 772 F.2d at p. 1067.)\nThe principles that we derive from Carroll and Galda, as well as Keller and Abood, are these: A university may, in general, support student groups through mandatory contributions because that use of funds can be germane to the university\u2019s educational mission. (Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at pp. 1001-1002; cf. Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 13-14], and Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 232-237 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 282-286].) At some point, however, the educational benefits that a group offers become incidental to the group\u2019s primary function of advancing its own political and ideological interests. (Galda, supra, 772 F.2d at pp. 1065, 1068; cf. Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 1002.) To fund such a group may still provide some educational benefits, but the incidental benefit to education will not usually justify the burden on the dissenting students\u2019 constitutional rights. Phrased in terms of the tests that courts have applied, a regulation that permits the mandatory funding of such groups is not \u201c \u2018narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary intrusion on freedom of expression\u2019 \u201d (Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 999, quoting Schad v. Mount Ephraim, supra, 452 U.S. at p. 69, fn. 7 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 681]; see also Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 1002), and it \u201cunnecessarily restricts] constitutionally protected liberty, [when] there is open a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interest\u201d (Galda v. Rutgers, supra, 772 F.2d at p. 1066).\nOne can reach the same result by applying the Carroll court\u2019s alternative formulation of the test. When mandatory funding is being used to create an incidental benefit to education at the cost of a significant burden on constitutional rights, it cannot usually be said that the state is \u201c \u2018promoting] a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d (Carroll, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 999, quoting Albertini, supra, 472 U.S. at p. 689 [86 L.Ed.2d at p. 548].)\nWe find no reason to doubt that the burden on dissenting students\u2019 speech and associational rights in this case is real and substantial. Students are, in fact, forced to support causes they strongly oppose. For example, students who favor abortion rights must pay to support the political activities of Berkeley Right to Life, a group opposed to abortion, and students opposed to abortion must subsidize groups such as Campus N.O.W. and Campus Abortion Rights Action League, which favor abortion rights. Another possible consequence of the current funding system was suggested at oral argument. Counsel for the ASUC acknowledged that a group which espoused the supremacy of a particular race would be eligible to receive mandatory fees so long as it permitted all students to join without discrimination. A sufficient remedy for the \u201cincidental infringement\u201d of the rights of a student of a different race, counsel suggested, would be to \u201cjoin that group and engage in vigorous debate within that group as to whether their ideas are acceptable or not.\u201d One might ask, rhetorically, whether being compelled to subsidize an organization whose goals one abhors is less of a burden than being compelled to display the state motto on a license plate (Wooley v. Maynard (1977) 430 U.S. 705, 714-717 [51 L.Ed.2d 752, 762-764, 97 S.Ct. 1428] [\u201cLive Free or Die\u201d]), a burden that the high court has found to be impermissible.\nThe ASUC does purport to have a standard for identifying those groups whose political activities are of such a nature as to disqualify them from receiving support from mandatory fees. Specifically, an ASUC rule requires that funds not be used for \u201cpartisan political activities or any ballot measure . . . .\u201d (ASUC, Policy & Procedure Manual, Guidelines for Funding Student Organizations, pp. 9-10.) However, the rule does not satisfy constitutional requirements, either on its face or as applied. While the rule on its face bars funding only for \u201cpartisan political\u201d activities, much broader concerns are at stake. The court\u2019s opinion in Abood, supra, 431 U.S. 209, makes this clear: \u201cIt is no doubt true that a central purpose of the First Amendment \u2018 \u201cwas to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] But our cases have never suggested that expression about philosophical, social, artistic, economic, literary, or ethical matters\u2014to take a nonexhaustive list of labels\u2014is not entitled to full First Amendment protection. Union members in both the public and private sectors may find that a variety of union activities conflict with their beliefs. [Citations.] Nothing in the First Amendment or our cases discussing its meaning makes the question whether the adjective \u2018political\u2019 can properly be attached to those beliefs the critical constitutional inquiry.\u201d (Id., at pp. 231-232 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 281-282], fn. omitted.)\nMoreover, as applied by the ASUC, the \u201cpartisan political\u201d rule actually permits the use of mandatory fees to fund a great deal of activity that is indisputably political and even \u201cpartisan\u201d by any reasonable definition. Indeed, the ASUC\u2019s executive vice-president testified at trial that the rule has been interpreted to bar funding only for the campus Young Republicans and Young Democrats. In contrast, the rule has been interpreted not to bar funding for \u201ca group that supports the nuclear freeze initiative,\u201d \u201corganizations that support the [proposed Equal Rights Amendment],\u201d \u201corganizations that hold demonstrations against the policies of the Reagan administration,\u201d \u201corganizations that oppose U.S. aid to the government of El Salvador,\u201d \u201c[organizations that oppose construction of the peripheral canal,\u201d \u201c[organizations that support gay rights legislation,\u201d \u201ca group that advocates replacement of our current form of government with a revolutionary socialist regime,\u201d and \u201ca group that supports abolition of the death penalty.\u201d Confronted with these funding decisions on cross-examination, the ASUC witness conceded that she could not articulate the criteria by which the ASUC determined whether a group was \u201cpartisan\u201d or \u201cnonpartisan.\u201d\nIf these examples left any doubt that the ASUC\u2019s \u201cpartisan political\u201d rule lacked any meaningful content, to be convinced of the point one would only need to consider the ASUC\u2019s decision to fund the Young Spartacus League. This group, according to the record, supported the former Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan, opposed the Solidarity movement in Poland, and, to quote its successful application for ASUC funding, \u201cseeks to build a revolutionary socialist movement which can intervene in all social struggles armed with a working class program based on the politics of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, as part of a disciplined revolutionary movement.\u201d We do not in any way mean to suggest that this group, or any group, should not be permitted to register with the University and attempt by all legitimate means to persuade other students of the correctness of its views. However, to fond the Young Spartacus League as \u201cnonpartisan,\u201d while denying funding to the Young Republicans and Young Democrats as \u201cpartisan,\u201d borders on the absurd.\nWe need not determine in the first instance whether each of the groups that plaintiffs specifically challenged at trial do or do not offer educational benefits that justify the infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 speech and associational rights. However, if the Regents decide to implement educational programs that entail burdens on constitutional rights they must ensure that the burdens are justified, and it is clear that they have made no serious effort to do so. At oral argument, counsel for the Regents argued that such a determination is virtually impossible to make because the terms \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d are vague. However, the high court has required labor unions and a state bar association to identify \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d activities that cannot properly be charged to mandatory contributors. (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 15 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 15]; Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 235-236 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 284-285].) As already discussed, the Regents have more discretion than the defendants in Keller and Abood in determining how to use mandatory fees because some student political activity is germane to the University\u2019s educational mission. However, when a group\u2019s educational function has become merely incidental to its political and ideological activities, then the infringement of dissenting students\u2019 constitutional rights can no longer be justified by the purported educational benefit. (Galda, supra, 772 F.2d at pp. 1065, 1067-1068.)\nSo long as the present system of funding student activity groups continues, the only practical way to protect the rights of dissenting students is to implement the procedures outlined in Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. 292, 301-310 [89 L.Ed.2d at pp. 243-249], and Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, 16-17 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 15-16]. These procedures will require the Regents to identify any groups that are ineligible for mandatory funding under the constitutional standards set out above and offer students the option of deducting a corresponding amount from the mandatory fee. The State Bar of California adopted a similar procedure to comply with the high court\u2019s decision in Keller, supra. Students who disagree with the Regents\u2019 calculation of the deduction will be entitled to the procedural safeguards articulated in Keller: \u201can adequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision-maker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.\u201d (496 U.S. at p. 16 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 16], internal quotation marks omitted.)\nWhile these procedures will obviously entail some administrative burden, they will not necessarily require the Regents to review each of the University\u2019s 150 registered student groups. Of these groups, the vast majority appear to have no discernible political or ideological interests; plaintiffs have challenged only 14. Moreover, as the high court has observed, even if such a procedure did \u201c \u2018result in some . . . administrative burden . . . and perhaps prove at times to be somewhat inconvenient, such additional burden or inconvenience is hardly sufficient to justify contravention of the constitutional mandate. It is noteworthy that unions representing government employees have developed, and have operated successfully within the parameters of Abood procedures for over a decade.\u2019 \u201d (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 16-17 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 16], quoting Keller v. State Bar (1989) 47 Cal.3d 1152, 1192 [255 Cal.Rptr. 542, 767 P.2d 1020] (conc, and dis. opn. of Kaufman, J.).)\nOf course, the Regents must provide a refund only to those students who object to the use of their fees for political and ideological activities. There is no legal barrier to funding such activities with the fees of students who do not object. Moreover, the refund will be necessary only so long as the Regents continue to subsidize political and ideological activities through mandatory fees. The Regents are free to adopt another system of funding student activities, such as a voluntary system, that avoids the constitutional defects identified in this opinion.\nC. ASUC-funded Lobbying.\nPlaintiffs have also challenged the ASUC\u2019s use of mandatory fees to lobby the state and municipal governments. Issues on which the ASUC has lobbied in the past include a nuclear freeze initiative, public transportation fares, city investment policy, zoning, rent control, rent discrimination, the use of registration fees to fund abortions, budget cuts for the University, and mandatory student fees.\nThe Court of Appeal disposed of plaintiffs\u2019 claim summarily, observing that \u201cthe record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that lobbying activities are confined to student and university issues.\u201d Applying the test of germaneness articulated in Keller (supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 13-14]) and Abood (supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 217-223, 232-237 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 272-277, 282-286]), the court concluded that \u201cno constitutional infringement occurred\u201d because the ASUC\u2019s lobbying activities \u201care related to the university\u2019s function.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning entails two serious flaws. First, the trial court did not make the finding on which the Court of Appeal purported to rely. Rather than finding that the ASUC\u2019s lobbying efforts had been confined to student- and university-related issues, the trial court in its statement of decision merely cited a University policy permitting the ASUC to lobby on such issues. In fact, there is undisputed evidence in the record that the ASUC has lobbied on issues that have no meaningful relationship to students as students or to the University, such as a nuclear freeze initiative and municipal investment policy.\nSecond, even if the ASUC\u2019s lobbying had been limited to student- and university-related issues, it does not follow that there is no constitutional problem. The Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning assumes that one of the ASUC\u2019s purposes is to represent student interests before the municipal and state governments and that lobbying on university-related issues is germane to that purpose under Keller (supra, 496 U.S. 1) and Abood (supra, 431 U.S. at 209.) However, plaintiffs\u2019 meritorious objections to this reasoning find no answer in the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion.\nPlaintiffs object, initially, that the analogy to collective bargaining is not truly apposite in this context. While the Regents have authorized the ASUC to communicate with government officials on public issues (University of Cal., Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, pt. A (rev. July 21,1978) \u00a7 63.00, at p. 18), the Regents have not purported to authorize the ASUC to negotiate with the government, or any other body, on students\u2019 behalf. Indeed, the relevant statement of policy negates any such implication by cautioning that the ASUC\u2019s permission to lobby \u201cdoes not affect the right of any student, as an individual, to petition government officials or bodies.\u201d (Ibid.) Furthermore, it is not clear that the state has any reason at all, let alone a compelling reason, to appoint a \u201cbargaining representative\u201d for students in their dealings with the government.\nPlaintiffs also argue that, even if the Regents had appointed the ASUC to represent student interests before government bodies, it does not follow that the permissible scope of lobbying would include all student- and university-related matters. A public employees\u2019 union, in comparison, may not use mandatory contributions to support lobbying on all union-related matters. This was the holding of Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn. (1991) 500 U.S. _114 L.Ed.2d 572, 111 S.Ct. 1950] (Lehnert). In that case, the high court held that \u201cthe State constitutionally may not compel its employees to subsidize legislative lobbying or other political union activities outside the limited context of contract ratification or implementation.\u201d (Id., at p.__[114 L.Ed.2d at p. 591], italics added.) Thus, while the plaintiffs in Lehnert, who were state college professors, could be compelled to subsidize a union\u2019s collective bargaining efforts, they could not be compelled to subsidize lobbying on matters other than collective bargaining, even matters as closely related to the union\u2019s interests as taxes for the support of public education. (Id., at p. _ [114 L.Ed.2d at p. 594].)\nThe high court\u2019s reasoning in Lehnert bears repeating because it appears to apply with equal force to the ASUC\u2019s lobbying efforts: \u201c[Allowing the use of dissenters\u2019 assessments for political activities outside the scope of the collective-bargaining context would present \u2018additional interference with the First Amendment interests of objecting employees.\u2019 [Citation.] There is no question as to the expressive and ideological content of these activities. Further, unlike discussion by negotiators regarding the terms and conditions of employment, lobbying and electoral speech is likely to concern topics about which individuals hold strong personal views. Although First Amendment protection is in no way limited to controversial topics or emotionally charged issues [citations], the extent of one\u2019s disagreement with the subject of compulsory speech is relevant to the degree of impingement upon free expression that compulsion will effect.\n\u201cThe burden upon freedom of expression is particularly great where, as here, the compelled speech is in a public context. By utilizing petitioners\u2019 funds for political lobbying and to garner the support of the public for its endeavors, the union would use each dissenter as \u2018an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable.\u2019 [Citation.] The First Amendment protects the individual\u2019s right of participation in these spheres from precisely this type of invasion. Where the subject of compelled speech is the discussion of governmental affairs, which is at the core of our First Amendment freedoms [citations], the burden upon dissenters\u2019 rights extends far beyond the acceptance of the agency shop and is constitutionally impermissible.\u201d (Lehnert, supra, 500 U.S. at p._[114 L.Ed.2d at p. 591].)\nThus, under Lehnert, even if the state has a sufficiently compelling interest to require unwilling persons to support an organization financially, the state may not compel support for lobbying efforts except on those matters that are strictly necessary to further the interest that justified the requirement of support. Applying this principle to the case before us compels us to reverse the judgment. Even if the Regents had appointed the ASUC to negotiate with governmental bodies on students\u2019 behalf, and even if the state had a compelling reason to do so, under Lehnert the state still could not force unwilling students to subsidize lobbying beyond the narrow subject matter that justified the requirement of support. However, the Regents have not claimed any interest in requiring students to support the ASUC\u2019s lobbying except the interest in providing an educational opportunity. In view of the \u201ccore\u201d political freedoms that are at stake (see Lehnert, supra, 500 U.S. at p.__[114 L.Ed.2d at p. 591]), the educational benefit to a few student lobbyists cannot justify the burden on all students\u2019 free speech and associational rights.\nFor these reasons, we hold that the Regents may not collect, from any student who objects, that portion of the mandatory fee that represents the cost of lobbying governmental bodies. Students who disagree with the Regents\u2019 calculation of the corresponding deduction will be entitled to the procedural safeguards set out above. (See Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. 292, 301-310 [89 L.Ed.2d at pp. 243-249]; Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, 16-17 [110 L.Ed.22d at pp. 15-16].)\nD. The ASUC Senate\u2019s Political Activities.\nFor many years, the ASUC Senate has debated, adopted, and publicized resolutions on current political issues. Issues that have received the ASUC Senate\u2019s attention include, for example, gay and lesbian rights, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, gun control, draft registration, boycotts of businesses involved in labor disputes, the reelection of a United States Representative, a municipal initiative to legalize marijuana, and the treatment of political prisoners in foreign countries. The ASUC Senate also supports voter registration, draft counselling, and renters\u2019 assistance programs. Plaintiffs introduced evidence at trial to show that these programs had occasionally become channels for political activity.\nPlaintiffs contend that the state may not compel them to finance these political activities through mandatory fees. In opposition, the Regents assert that no income from mandatory contributions has been used to support such activities. The trial court did not specifically address this issue in its statement of decision. The Court of Appeal upheld the ASUC Senate\u2019s political activities, but it did not rely on the Regents\u2019 theory that no mandatory fees have been used to subsidize them. Instead, avoiding the unresolved factual issue, the court purported to uphold the ASUC Senate\u2019s political activities as a matter of law. The court reasoned that such activities \u201ccontribute[] to the educational mission of the university\u201d and that, if plaintiffs did not approve of positions taken by the ASUC Senate, \u201cthere is nothing to prevent plaintiffs from seeking senate office and making their own voices heard in the senate debates.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s resolution of this issue cannot withstand scrutiny. To be sure, the ASUC Senate\u2019s practice of taking and publicizing positions on political issues may have educational value for those few students who are involved. However, as already discussed, if mandatory fees are used for this purpose there is a burden on dissenting students\u2019 speech and associational rights. The Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis is incomplete because it made no effort to determine whether the purported educational benefits justify the burden. Indeed, the court betrayed a certain indifference to plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims in suggesting that the remedy for compelled speech lies in more compelled speech, i.e., suggesting that plaintiffs \u201cseek[] senate office and mak[e] their own voices heard in the senate debates.\u201d\nOf course, there would be no need to address plaintiffs\u2019 claim if it were true, as the Regents assert, that no income from mandatory fees has been used to support the ASUC Senate\u2019s political activities. However, the Regents\u2019 position seems to contradict the trial court\u2019s finding that mandatory fees were used for \u201coperation expenditures for the ASUC Senate.\u201d The Regents\u2019 position also seems to contradict the ASUC\u2019s response to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories. In their interrogatories, plaintiffs asked the ASUC to \u201c[s]tate what steps ASUC has taken to publicize resolutions adopted by the ASUC Senate.\u201d The ASUC answered that it had \u201cplaced ads in the Daily Cal [a student newspaper]; distributed posters, leaflets and flyers; published ASUC information books; sent out press releases to major media; sponsored on-campus discussion groups, workshops and rallies; [and] placed notices on campus bulletin boards and kiosks . . . .\u201d These forms of publicity usually entail costs, if only for paper and ink.\nThe Regents\u2019 assertion that mandatory fees have not been used to subsidize the ASUC\u2019s political activities could also mean that the ASUC segregates mandatory fees from other sources of income and uses the former only for nonpolitical purposes. The earmarking of funds, however, would not necessarily eliminate the constitutional problem. In Abood (supra, 431 U.S. 209, 237, fn. 35 [52 L.Ed.2d p. 285]), the high court rejected earmarking as a remedy for constitutional violations caused by the use of mandatory fees for political purposes. Because earmarking leaves the same total amount of funds at the organization\u2019s disposal and permits the organization to spend the same amount on political activities, earmarking \u201c \u2018is of bookkeeping significance only rather than a matter of real substance.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn (1963) 373 U.S. 746, 753 [10 L.Ed.2d 678, 683, 83 S.Ct. 1461 ].) For these reasons, the Court has held in the agency-shop context that \u201cit is plainly not an adequate remedy to limit the use of the actual dollars collected from dissenting employees to collective-bargaining [i.e., non-political and non-ideological] purposes . . . (Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 237, fn. 35 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 285].)\nIn view of the foregoing discussion, it is evident that the lower courts have not yet adequately addressed the factual and legal issues raised by the ASUC Senate\u2019s own political activities. If further evidentiary proceedings show that mandatory fees have been spent on political activities by the ASUC Senate, then the Regents shall have the burden of demonstrating that the resulting burden on dissenting students\u2019 speech and associational rights is germane to, and justified by, such activities\u2019 educational value in accordance with the principles discussed above. If the Regents do not satisfy that burden, then plaintiffs will be entitled to relief under the procedures set out in Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, 16-17 [110 L.Ed.2d 1 at pp. 15-16], and Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. 292, 301-310 [89 L.Ed.2d 232 at pp. 243-249], We shall remand these issues for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed herein.\nIn view of our determination that plaintiffs are entitled to relief on their claims regarding student groups and ASUC lobbying, and that further proceedings must take place on plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the ASUC Senate\u2019s political activities, there is no need at this stage of the proceeding to address plaintiffs\u2019 alternative claims to the same relief under article IX, section 9 of the state Constitution, section 13 of the Organic Act (Stats. 1867-1868, ch. CCXLIV, \u00a7 13, p. 254)), Stanson v. Mott, supra, 17 Cal.3d 206, and the federal Constitution\u2019s establishment clause (U.S. Const., Amend. I).\nIII. Disposition\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed insofar as it holds that the Regents of the University have power to impose and collect a mandatory student activities fee. In all other respects the judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the Court of Appeal, which shall direct the superior court to conduct further proceedings, and to grant relief, in accordance with this opinion.\nLucas, C. J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., and George, J., concurred.\n\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right. A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of the speech or press.\u201d\n\u201cThe people have the right to instruct their representatives, petition government for redress of grievances, and assemble freely to consult for the common good.\u201d\n\u201c. . . The university shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs . . . .\u201d\nSee footnote 4, ante.\n\u201c[N]o sectarian, political or partisan test shall ever be allowed or exercised in the appointment of Regents, or in the election of professors, teachers, or other officers of the University, or in the admission of students thereto, or for any purpose whatsoever . . . .\"(Id., at p. 254.)\nThe state Constitution also guarantees speech, associational, and political rights in comparable, but independent, provisions. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, subd. (a), 3; see id., art. I, \u00a7 24 [\u201cRights guaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the United States Constitution\u201d].) Because we find that plaintiffs are entitled to relief on other grounds, we need not address the effect of these provisions.\nDecisions upholding the use of mandatory fees to create public fora, such as student newspapers and speakers\u2019 bureaus, offer little assistance in resolving this case. (E.g., Kania v. Fordham (4th Cir. 1983) 702 F.2d 475; Arrington v. Taylor (M.D.N.C. 1974) 380 F.Supp. 1348; Veed v. Schwartzkopf (D.Neb. 1973) 353 F.Supp. 149.) No one argues that any of the student groups involved in the case before us is a public forum. To the contrary, the record clearly demonstrates that each is expressly devoted to advancing its own political and ideological causes.\nOther decisions cited by the dissent to show that students may be compelled to fund political and ideological causes (Lace v. University of Vermont (1973) 131 Vt. 170 [303 A.2d 475]; Good v. Associated Students of Univ. of Washington (1975) 86 Wn.2d 94 [542 P.2d 762]) do little to support that position. The court in Good held that a student association receiving mandatory fees could not \u201cbecome a vehicle for the promotion of one particular viewpoint, political, social, economic or religious,\u201d and remanded for evidentiary proceedings to determine whether the university had failed to enforce its own guidelines on the use'of funds. (Good, supra, 542 P.2d at pp. 769-770.) The Lace court rejected a challenge to mandatory fees, but only because the record did not show that the student plaintiffs had \u201ceither pled or proved that they were required through the assessment of the mandatory student activities fee to finance the promotion of religious, political, or philosophical causes.\u201d (Lace, supra, 303 A.2d at p. 479.)\n\u201d[A]n incidental burden on speech is no greater than is essential, and therefore is permissible under O\u2019Brien, so long as the neutral regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u201d (Albertini, supra, 472 U.S. at p. 689 [86 L.Ed.2d atp. 548].)\nIn United States v. O\u2019Brien (1968) 391 U.S. 367 [20 L.Ed.2d 672, 88 S.Ct. 1673], to which the Albertini opinion refers, the high court applied strict scrutiny to a symbolic conduct case.\n\u201cApplication of a facially neutral regulation that incidentally burdens speech satisfies the First Amendment if it \u2018furthers an important or substantial government interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.' \u201d (Albertini, supra, 472 U.S. at pp. 687-688 [86 L.Ed.2d at p. 547], quoting United States v. O\u2019Brien, supra, 391 U.S. at p. 377 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 680].)\nWidmar v. Vincent (1981) 454 U.S. 263 [70 L.Ed.2d 440, 102 S.Ct. 269], which the Regents and the ASUC cite, does not compel a contrary conclusion. There, the high court held that a state university that made its facilities generally available for the activities of student groups could not close its facilities to one group because of its religious nature. But the high court did not hold that the university was required to create a forum generally open to student groups, let alone a particular type of forum. And the high court\u2019s opinion, while mentioning that the groups in question were funded by a student activities fee (id., at p. 265 [70 L.Ed.2d at p, 444]), said nothing about the propriety of such funding or the problem of compelled speech.\nA \u201cpartisan\u201d is generally defined as \u201cone that takes the part of another: an adherent to a party, faction, cause, or person . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Diet. (1982) p. 1647.)\n\u201cStudent governments shall have the right to address and take positions on public issues. Positions on issues taken by student governments shall not be represented as or deemed to be official positions of the University. Compulsory student fees shall not be expended in support of such positions except for University-related purposes. Any communications by student governments or units thereof to Federal, State, or local government officials or bodies on such issues must avoid any implication that the positions taken are sponsored, endorsed, or favored by the University. This does not affect the right of any student, as an individual, to petition governmental officials or bodies.\u201d",

However, in holding that the University of California at Berkeley (University) violates the United States Constitution by promoting the dissemination of controversial ideas, the court itself violates that fundamental charter of freedom. In premising this holding on a spurious and ill-defined distinction between \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d speech, the majority abdicate their primary duty of reasoned adjudication, and condemn the University and the lower courts to additional and futile litigation. In disdaining unanimous state and federal case law to the contrary, they underscore their isolation from mainstream jurisprudence. In purporting to reach this unfortunate result under compulsion of United States Supreme Court precedent, they fundamentally misread the high court\u2019s landmark decisions, and contravene the spirit of their holdings.\nAccordingly, I must dissent. Contrary to the majority, I would hold that the funding of student groups engaged in on-campus speech\u2014regardless of political or ideological content\u2014is germane to the University\u2019s educational mission and serves compelling national interests. As long as the funds are distributed in a neutral fashion and are not used to promote partisan political purposes, to finance off-campus activities or to interfere with the free speech rights of others, such funding is well encompassed within the constitutional mandate of the University.\nIntroduction\nLet us be clear about what is at issue here. The dispute centers on the University\u2019s considered educational judgment that student groups who distribute leaflets, show films, sponsor speakers and organize discussion forums on the University campus, help contribute to the mission of the University and therefore may be reimbursed for certain limited expenses from the fund generated by the mandatory student fee. The majority reject the University\u2019s judgment. They believe, rather, that because some students disagree with the \u201cpolitical\u201d views expressed by certain groups, the First Amendment rights of the dissenting students must take precedence. They hold that where the \u201ceducational benefit\u201d of such speech is merely \u201cincidental\u201d to its \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cideological\u201d message, it may not constitutionally be funded from the mandatory fee.\nTo those who honor the Constitution, respect academic freedom, and strive to uphold the integrity and rationality of the courts, the majority decision will be greeted as a jurisprudential debacle. It fails completely\u2014in fact it makes virtually no effort\u2014to explain, much less support, its holding that speech with an \u201cideological\u201d or \u201cpolitical\u201d message is any less educationally beneficial than speech which lacks such political content. Indeed, the majority betray a shocking ignorance of the University\u2019s educational mission and the vital state interest that it serves\u2014the regeneration of those fundamental republican virtues upon which this nation was founded, and upon which its continued commitment to civil liberty depends. I am referring, of course, to the power and determination of its citizens to form and express their own opinions, to critically evaluate the opinions of others, and, most importantly, to tolerate the opinions of those with whom they most disagree.\nThe funding of on-campus activities groups engaged in a broad variety of speech\u2014controversial, political, ideological, social, cultural\u2014no matter how annoying or disagreeable to some, plays an integral role in the University\u2019s mission. Indeed, such speech is inherently educational. It is not the \u201cprice\u201d students pay for a university education, it is the very essence of that education.\nThe majority\u2019s ill-conceived dichotomy between \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d speech does more, however, than simply misunderstand the nature of the University and its critical role in our political culture. The majority provide virtually no guidance to the parties and the lower courts to distinguish between \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d speech. The record contains literally dozens of leaflets, pamphlets and broadsides posted and distributed on campus by the student groups that plaintiffs oppose. Which of these lacks sufficient \u201ceducational\u201d content to be eligible for reimbursement of printing costs? The leaflet distributed by Women Organized Against Sexual Harassment inviting students to a workshop to \u201ctalk about our experiences. . . . [and] to provide legal, emotional and political support?\u201d The leaflet distributed by the Berkeley Feminist Alliance announcing a documentary film \u201cagainst militarism, poverty, and oppression\u201d and sponsoring a speaker from El Salvador \u201cspeaking on women\u2019s involvement in the struggle there?\u201d A broadside sponsored by the Education & Action Project announcing a rally of \u201cspeakers and music\u201d to protest the President\u2019s environmental and social policies? The majority provide no guidance to the lower courts and the Regents to judge the \u201ceducational benefit\u201d of these pamphlets; it is virtually anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe majority\u2019s reluctance to provide specific standards or illustrations is easy to understand. The dichotomy between \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d speech is a false and pernicious one. It purports to judge the educational value of speech on the extent of its political message or ideological viewpoint. Such an enterprise is fraught with peril, to the academic freedom of the University, and to the right of all Americans to think and speak freely.\nPerhaps this is why the majority, having created such a troubling doctrine, are unable to apply it. Instead, in \u201cdeference\u201d to the University\u2019s academic judgment, the majority remand the matter to the Regents to separate the \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d groups from the excessively \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cideological,\u201d and to adopt a funding mechanism reflecting these decisions. Confronted with the court\u2019s holding, the Regents\u2019 practical options are limited, and none of them is appealing: (1) Abolish the mandatory fee altogether on every University campus (not a likely scenario, in light of the Regents\u2019 demonstrated commitment to the funding of student speech); (2) attempt to comply with the court\u2019s holding, which will unleash a firestorm of protest and lawsuits by those groups deemed (by whatever arbitrary standards the University might devise) too \u201cpolitical\u201d to warrant funding; or (3) maintain their current position that all of the University\u2019s registered groups are \u201ceducationally beneficial,\u201d a conclusion clearly in defiance of the majority\u2019s implication that certain groups, such as the Young Spartacus League (which according to its charter \u201cseeks to build a revolutionary socialist movement . . . .\u201d) fall in the noneducational category. This will undoubtedly trigger a new lawsuit by plaintiffs to enforce the \u201cprinciples\u201d set forth in the majority opinion. The court\u2019s opinion, in short, will only generate further litigation in a vain attempt to decipher its cryptic and misguided holding.\nThe crux of the constitutional issue is cogently presented here; the dispositive determination has been made; a remand advances the issue not a step further. The majority\u2019s holding that the University is constitutionally forbidden to fund student speech whose \u201ceducational benefit\u201d is only incidental to its \u201cideological\u201d viewpoint represents such a radical departure from educational reality and settled law (as will appear, all of the case law is to the contrary) that I urge the University to petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari, and that high court to grant review.\nDiscussion\nA. Summary\nThe precise question presented is whether the First Amendment to the United States Constitution compels the dismantling of a system of mandatory student fees utilized by the University and other University of California campuses throughout the state to finance student government and activities groups. Plaintiffs, Berkeley students who disagree with the views expressed by many of the groups receiving such funds, contend that the mandatory fee constitutes a species of compelled speech prohibited by the First Amendment as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in such cases as Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977) 431 U.S. 209 [52 L.Ed.2d 261, 97 S.Ct. 1782] (Abood) and Keller v. State Bar of California (1990) 496 U.S. 1 [110 L.Ed.2d 1, 110 S.Ct. 2228] (Keller)\nThe question plaintiffs raise is an important one. As Justice Jackson eloquently observed, our Constitution permits \u201cno official, high or petty, [to] prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion . . . .\u201d (Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) 319 U.S. 624, 642 [87 L.Ed. 1628, 1639, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 147 A.L.R. 674]; accord, Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 10 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 11-12]; Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 235 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 284-285].) Indeed, the University\u2019s educational mission is precisely to combat orthodoxy by encouraging the dissemination of a multiplicity of views and interests, many of which will inevitably provoke controversy, debate and opposition. The collection and disbursement of the mandatory fee play an integral part in the University\u2019s educational function, by providing students with the modest financial assistance necessary to engage in student government and parliamentary debate, to organize around common interests, and to advocate and argue ideas in the spirited intellectual atmosphere of the university campus.\nThus, while we look to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions for guidance, the fact remains that we are confronted with an institution whose scope and purposes are altogether different from the labor union in Abood or the state bar in Keller. The latter constitute highly specialized vocational groups, organized around the narrow interests of a single industry or profession and designed to speak for those interests with essentially one voice. These constraints, the United States Supreme Court has concluded, require strict limits on the uses to which their members\u2019 mandatory dues may be put. (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 13-16 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 13-16]; Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 233-236 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 283-285].)\nA university is different; its interests are not narrowly vocational, but broadly educational; its mission is centered not on the goal of representing an industry or a profession, but on the concept that intellectual growth and fulfillment require a \u201cwide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth \u2018out of a multitude of tongues . . . . \u2019 \u201d (Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967) 385 U.S. 589, 603 [17 L.Ed.2d 629, 640, 87 S.Ct. 675], italics added.) The dissemination of often controversial and even disagreeable ideas goes to the very heart of the university experience. Application of the mandatory fee to the communication of such ideas furthers goals that are not only \u201cgermane\u201d (Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 235 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 284]) but integral to the University\u2019s educational objectives.\nAccordingly, subject to the limitations set forth below, I would hold that the exaction and use of the mandatory student fee to support student government and activities is consistent with the First Amendment and Supreme Court precedent.\nB. Constitutional Background\nAlthough this case raises constitutional issues in a context not heretofore considered by this or the United States Supreme Court, our analysis is informed by existing precedent.\nAt the outset, it is important to recognize, as the United States Supreme Court has observed, that we confront \u201cdelicate issues concerning the academic community.\u201d (Healy v. James (1972) 408 U.S. 169, 171 [33 L.Ed.2d 266, 273-274, 92 S.Ct. 2338].) Contemporary concerns over \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d notwithstanding, the American university remains among the world\u2019s freest forums for intellectual inquiry and debate. We must approach our task, therefore, \u201cwith special caution\u201d (ibid.), understanding that the institution\u2019s continued vitality and independence are contingent upon its freedom from disruptive judicial interference.\nRestraint does not imply complaisance, however. \u201cIt can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201d (Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School Dist. (1969) 393 U.S. 503, 506 [21 L.Ed.2d 731, 737, 89 S.Ct. 733].) Indeed, as the high court has written, \u201cthe precedents of this Court leave no room for the view that . . . First Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large. Quite to the contrary, \u2018[t]he vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.\u2019 \u201d (Healy v. James, supra, 408 U.S. at p. 180 [33 L.Ed.2d at p. 279], quoting Shelton v. Tucker (1960) 364 U.S. 479, 487 [5 L.Ed.2d 231, 236-237, 81 S.Ct. 247].) Thus, far from dulling our powers of review, the University\u2019s unique status as a forum for free expression impels a sharpened judicial scrutiny, sensitive to both institutional interests and the constitutional rights of the individual.\nPlaintiffs contend that their First Amendment guarantees of free speech and association have been violated by the University through the imposition and use of the mandatory student fee. More particularly, they oppose as compelled speech and association the University\u2019s allotment of a portion of their student fees to the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), for the purpose of financing the advocacy of political and ideological views which they reject. They also contend that the Regents lack the authority to impose a mandatory student fee. I shall address the constitutional claim first, as it constitutes by far the more weighty and serious challenge.\nAlthough on its face the First Amendment protects neither the right of association nor the right to be free from compelled speech and association, both rights are now well established in our jurisprudence. The United States Supreme Court has declared that the activities expressly protected by the First Amendment\u2014to speak, assemble, petition for redress of grievances and exercise one\u2019s religion\u2014encompass a complementary right to \u201cassociate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.\u201d (Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609, 622 [82 L.Ed.2d 462, 474, 104 S.Ct. 3244].) This right of expressive association, in turn, \u201cpresupposes a freedom not to associate.\u201d (Id. at p. 623 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 475].) Similarly, the high court has held that the First Amendment right to speak implies a corresponding right to \u201crefrain from speaking.\u201d (Wooley v. Maynard (1977) 430 U.S. 705, 714 [51 L.Ed.2d 752, 762, 97 S.Ct. 1428].) As the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, 319 U.S. 624, 631 [87 L.Ed.2d 1628, 1634], declared, the Constitution guarantees the individual freedom from \u201ccompulsion ... to declare a belief.\u201d\nC. Compulsory Dues Under the First Amendment\nThese principles have been extended by the Supreme Court to prohibit the state from exacting compulsory contributions to unions for purposes not germane to the collective bargaining process. The pivotal case in this area is Abood, supra, 431 U.S. 209. There, the Supreme Court recognized that state laws authorizing unions and management to enter into \u201cagency shop\u201d agreements requiring every employee, whether or not a member of the union, to pay the union a service charge, impinge upon the employee\u2019s right to be free from compelled speech and association. Nevertheless, the court concluded that any interference with the employees\u2019 First Amendment rights was \u201cconstitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress.\u201d (Id. at p. 222 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 276].) At the same time, however, the court found meritorious the argument that employees \u201cmay constitutionally prevent the Union\u2019s spending a part of their required service fees to contribute to political candidates and to express political views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining representative.\u201d (Id. at p. 234 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 283],)\nAbood, supra, 431 U.S. 209, did not prohibit a union from spending funds for the expression of political views unrelated to its collective bargaining function; it merely held that dissenting employees may not be coerced into financing such activities. (Id. at p. 235 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 284-285].) Nor did Abood attempt to formulate a standard for distinguishing between collective bargaining activities and undertakings unrelated to collective bargaining, or to prescribe the procedures necessary to ensure that objecting employees did not finance such nongermane speech. (Id. at p. 236 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 285].) Subsequently, however, in Ellis v. Railway Clerks (1984) 466 U.S. 435 [80 L.Ed.2d 428, 104 S.Ct. 1883], the high court declared that a union activity may be financed out of compulsory dues if it is \u201cnormally or reasonably employed to implement or effectuate\u201d the union\u2019s duties as exclusive bargaining representative. (Id. at p. 448 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 442], italics added.) And in Chicago Teachers v. Hudson (1986) 475 U.S. 292 [89 L.Ed.2d 232, 106 S.Ct. 1066], the court held that \u201cthe constitutional requirements for the Union\u2019s collection of agency fees include an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.\u201d (Id. at p. 310 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 249].)\nRecently, in Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, the United States Supreme Court extended the Abood analysis to an integrated state bar, reaffirming its earlier conclusion in Lathrop v. Donahue (1961) 367 U.S. 820 [6 L.Ed.2d 1191, 81 S.Ct. 1826], that the exaction of compulsory bar dues does not per se violate an individual\u2019s rights, but holding that the First Amendment prohibits the expenditure of members\u2019 dues on speech unrelated to the regulation of the legal profession. Reasoning by analogy from Abood and its progeny, the high court acknowledged the integrated bar\u2019s impingement on members\u2019 First Amendment rights, but held that the compelled association was \u201cjustified by the State\u2019s interest in regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services.\u201d (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14].) It followed that the California State Bar may constitutionally fund speech \u201cgermane\u201d to these goals, i.e., \u201cnecessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or \u2018improving the quality of . . . legal service,\u2019 \u201d but may not finance \u201cactivities of an ideological nature which fall outside of those areas of activity.\u201d (Id. at p. 14 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14].) While declining to define \u201c[precisely where the line falls,\u201d the high court nevertheless observed that \u201cthe extreme ends of the spectrum are clear: Compulsory dues may not be expended to endorse or advance a gun control or nuclear weapons freeze initiative; at the other end of the spectrum petitioners have no valid constitutional objection to their compulsory dues being spent for activities connected with disciplining members of the Bar or proposing ethical codes for the profession.\u201d (Id. at pp. 15-16 [110 L.Ed.2d at P- 15].)\nNeither Abood nor Keller addressed directly the constitutional standard to be applied in balancing the state\u2019s interests in the collection and use of a mandatory fee against the infringement of associational rights occasioned thereby. In upholding the imposition of compulsory union dues in Abood, however, the high court referred to \u201cimportant government interests\u201d served by the union shop in the system of labor relations established by Congress. (431 U.S. at pp. 222, 225 [52 L.Ed.2d at pp. 275-276, 278], italics added.) Similarly, Keller's discussion of the integrated state bar spoke in terms of \u201csubstantial public interests,\u201d and held that the expenditure of mandatory dues must be \u201cnecessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose\u201d of effectuating those interests. (496 U.S. at pp. 13-14 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14], italics added.) Interestingly, neither decision explicitly applied a strict scrutiny standard, thus triggering the need for a compelling state interest and narrow legislative tailoring to accomplish the governmental objective. (See Elrod v. Burns (1976) 427 U.S. 347, 362 [49 L.Ed.2d 547, 559, 96 S.Ct. 2673].) One federal circuit court, as a result, has applied a middle-tier test to determine the constitutionality of mandatory student fees, inquiring whether the state interests served by the fees are sufficiently important or substantial to justify the First Amendment infringement. (Carroll v. Blinken (2d Cir. 1992) 957 F.2d 991, 999, cert. den. _ U.S. _ [121 L.Ed.2d 224, 113 S.Ct. 300] [\u201cWe . . . look to see whether the regulation \u2018promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d]; see also Cantor, Forced Payments to Service Institutions and Constitutional Interests in Ideological Non-Association (1984) 36 Rutgers L. Rev. 3, 29-35 [hereafter Cantor]; but cf. Galda v. Bloustein (3d Cir. 1982) 686 F.2d 159, 164.)\nNevertheless, plaintiffs here maintain that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review. They note that in Chicago Teachers v. Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. 292, the Supreme Court stated that a union\u2019s rebate procedures for dues expended in violation of Abood must be \u201ccarefully tailored to minimize the [First Amendment] infringement.\u201d (Id. at p. 303 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 245].) And in Elrod v. Burns, supra, 427 U.S. 347, the court observed generally that a \u201csignificant impairment of First Amendment rights must survive exacting scrutiny.\u201d (Id. at p. 362 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 559].)\nAlthough suggestive, these statements in Elrod and Hudson are less than altogether persuasive, particularly in light of the high court\u2019s pointed failure to endorse a strict scrutiny standard in the two seminal decisions\u2014Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, and Abood, supra, 431 U.S. 209\u2014where one would reasonably expect it. I shall, accordingly, apply the standard expressly prescribed by the high court, inquiring whether the mandatory student fee serves \u201cimportant\u201d (Abood, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 225 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 278]) or \u201csubstantial\u201d (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 13 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14]) state interests, and whether the ASUC expenditures are \u201cnecessarily or reasonably incurred\u201d (id. at p. 14 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14]) to effectuate those interests.\nD. Constitutionality of ASUC Expenditures\nWith the foregoing principles in mind, I turn to the critical issues before us: What is the defining mission of the University for purposes of First Amendment analysis under Keller and Abood, does that mission serve important state interests, and is the mandatory student fee reasonably employed to effectuate that mission? In resolving these questions, I shall consider the exaction and expenditure issues together, for, as Keller instructs, to define the interests which justify the imposition of a mandatory fee is to delineate the constitutional uses to which such funds may be put. (Keller, supra, 496 U.S. at p. 13 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 14] [The First Amendment forbids the expenditure of mandatory dues for \u201cideological activities not \u2018germane\u2019 to the purpose for which compelled association was justified . . . .\u201d].) Each of the parties\u2019, as well as the majority\u2019s, responses to these critical questions will be considered in turn.\n(1) Plaintiffs\u2019 Response\nUnfortunately, plaintiffs do not attempt to define the University\u2019s mission for purposes of delineating its funding limitations. They simply assert that any expenditure of the mandatory fee must be germane to \u201cstudents in their capacity as students\u201d and must exclude activities \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201ccontroversial\u201d in nature. Presumably implied in these assertions is some principle limiting the University\u2019s purpose to \u201cstudent-oriented\u201d or noncontroversial subjects. Regretfully, however, plaintiffs also fail to elaborate on these rather vague categories. \u201cStudents in their capacity as students\u201d apparently excludes, for plaintiffs, any issue or activity which is pertinent to students as members of the \u201ccommunity\u201d at large. Plaintiffs provide few specifics, but this would apparently exclude funding such groups as the League of Arab Students and the UC Polish Dance Club, since both routinely address subjects that transcend the University campus. Plaintiffs would apparently permit the funding of speech related specifically to classes, curricula, athletics and perhaps tuition.\nObviously, there are a number of constitutional and practical problems with this approach. Plaintiffs do not explain, in terms of Keller and Abood, why the funding of the UC Rally Committee (which presumably relates to \u201cstudents in their capacity as students\u201d) is constitutionally permissible, i.e, serves important or substantial state interests, but the funding of Berkeley Students for Peace does not. Nor do plaintiffs adequately explain why scores of student groups which speak to issues pertinent to both the campus and the world at large, like the Native American Student Association and Women in the Sciences, are not germane to the University\u2019s mission. Perhaps the most obvious problem with plaintiffs\u2019 argument, however (discussed more fully below), is that it denies support to groups, such as those previously mentioned, with much to contribute to the education of University students.\nPlaintiffs additional (or possibly alternative) approach is to fund only those groups not engaged in what plaintiffs label \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201ccontroversial\u201d speech. Plaintiffs assert that Abood prohibits, at a minimum, compulsory contributions to political views which they oppose. However, there are legal and practical problems with this standard, as well. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contention, Abood does not prohibit \u201cpolitical\u201d speech per se. Indeed, the Supreme Court in Abood explicitly recognized that an agency shop may take \u201cpolitical\u201d positions in furtherance of its collective bargaining function which its members may be compelled constitutionally to support. As the high court stated: \u201cUnion members in both the public and private sectors may find that a variety of union activities conflict with their beliefs. [Citation.] Nothing in the First Amendment or our cases discussing its meaning makes the question whether the adjective \u2018political\u2019 can properly be attached to those beliefs the critical constitutional inquiry.\u201d (431 U.S. at pp. 231-232 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 282].) The critical question, rather, was whether the union used mandatory dues to \u201cexpress political views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining representative.\u201d (Id. at p. 234 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 283].)\nPlaintiffs also fail to define \u201cpolitical\u201d in this context or relate it to \u201cstudents in their capacity as students.\u201d An African-American student group which distributes leaflets asserting that the University discriminates against Blacks because it hires too few tenured Black professors is arguably engaged in speech relating to \u201cstudents in their capacity as students.\u201d Yet the leaflet obviously implicates \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201ccontroversial\u201d issues relating to race, affirmative action, the validity of statistics to prove discrimination, and the like. Moreover, plaintiffs do not explain where \u201cstudent\u201d speech ends and \u201cpolitical\u201d speech begins. When Students for a Better Understanding of China sponsors a film which reflects positively on the culture of mainland China, is it speech relating to \u201cstudents in their capacity as students\u201d or is it \u201cpolitical\u201d? Speech that might seem perfectly innocuous to some could appear highly controversial to others, in this case perhaps to students from Taiwan. The most telling deficiency in plaintiffs\u2019 argument, however, is its failure, once again, to articulate any defining theory of the University\u2019s mission; accordingly, there is no attempt to explain why the aforementioned Chinese or African-American groups\u2019 speech is not germane to the University\u2019s mission, but the California Yell Leaders\u2019 exhortations are.\n(2) The Majority\u2019s Response\nAll of these flaws are manifest in the majority opinion, which concludes that at some undefined point the \u201ceducational benefits\u201d of a student group\u2019s speech becomes \u201cincidental\u201d to its \u201cpolitical or ideological interests,\u201d at which point funding from the mandatory fee becomes unconstitutional. The majority attempt to avoid all of the aforementioned difficulties inherent in this approach\u2014not least of which is articulating meaningful standards for distinguishing between \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d and \u201cpolitical or ideological speech\u201d\u2014by referring the problem back to the Regents of the University (\u201c. . . they must ensure that the burdens are justified.\u201d) Having done so, the Regents must then institute a \u201cHudson\u201d deduction (Chicago Teachers v. Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. 292) permitting students to deduct that portion of their mandatory fee budgeted for \u201cpolitical or ideological\u201d activities.\nThis analysis is wholly untenable. As a practical matter, it raises a host of unanswered and unanswerable questions; as a legal ruling, it places the University in an impossible position. For example, is a film sponsored by the Chinese Students Association depicting the recent events at Tiananmen Square \u201ceducational\u201d or \u201cpolitical\u201d? The majority do not even provide a means of analyzing the question, much less of finding an answer. How would the majority characterize a student-sponsored forum on affirmative action in the University\u2019s admissions process, or a leaflet urging the University to divest its holdings in South Africa, or a speaker on the environmental ramifications of logging old-growth timber? Absent any meaningful standards in the majority opinion, how is the University possibly to characterize these activities? And how, moreover, is it to deal with the inflammatory consequences of labeling some groups \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d and therefore eligible for funding through the mandatory fee, while listing others as \u201cpolitical\u201d and therefore ineligible? However the University decides, it will face a renewed barrage of legal challenges.\nPerhaps in tacit recognition of these intractable problems, the majority observe that the University is \u201cfree\u201d to adopt \u201canother\u201d undefined method of funding, so long as it avoids the constitutional infirmities of funding \u201cpolitical\u201d speech. The irony of the majority\u2019s solicitude for academic \u201cfreedom\u201d in a decision which does irreparable damage to that principle will not be lost on the reader. In any event, the majority\u2019s holding thus comes to this: Expression on campus contributes to the educational mission of the University, but not if the \u201cpolitical or ideological\u201d content of the expression exceeds its \u201ceducational benefits\u201d; the majority refuse, however, to define this dichotomy; the Regents are in no position to do so; therefore, on remand the Regents may consider \u201canother\u201d method of funding.\nSuch reasoning does not do this court credit. If the majority cannot define its own standard, it should not ask the University to do so. And if the University is free, as the majority acknowledge, to impose a mandatory fee for certain \u201ceducationally beneficial\u201d speech, then it should not be forced, in effect, to adopt an all-voluntary system. For that is the only practical alternative, short of defiance, left to the University: Abolish the student fee, or adopt a \u201ccheck-off\u2019 system which permits each student to contribute to the groups of his or her choice. In either case, funding will soon devolve into a political popularity contest. Thus, in a setting where provocative ideas should receive the most support and encouragement, precisely the opposite will occur; student groups will be subject to an ideological referendum, and the most marginal groups will receive the least financial assistance. This is truly Orwellian.\n(3) The University\u2019s Mission\nThe University, for its part, submits that its overarching purpose is \u201cto educate\u201d students, and contends that it may constitutionally support activities which further this expansive goal. Student government, lobbying and extracurricular activities groups, the University argues, serve important educational interests by training students in self-government, providing an organized forum to discuss and debate public issues of the day, exposing students to a multiplicity of cultural and political viewpoints and developing social and rhetorical skills.\nThe University is undoubtedly correct that its essential mission is \u201cto educate\u201d and that student government and extracurricular activities supplement this worthy goal. \u201cEducation\u201d is unquestionably a valuable end in itself. But the constitutional issue is whether the University\u2019s mission serves an important state interest, and whether the funding of student groups engaged in speech which plaintiffs oppose serves reasonably to effectuate that interest. As explained below, I conclude that both questions must be answered in the affirmative.\nThat the state derives important benefits from an informed and enlightened citizenry is a proposition almost too familiar to warrant discussion. Political and educational philosophers from Plato to Thomas Jefferson and John Dewey have observed that the principal object of education is to prepare youth for the fullest participation in society. In teaching the student the university is simultaneously training the citizen. Indeed, they are but two sides of the same coin. To perform responsibly not just as citizen, but as worker, family member, friend and neighbor, a student must acquire both knowledge as well as the critical power of choice and self-direction. A liberal education consists of more than simply achieving an acquaintance with the great poets, philosophers, scientists and statesmen, although that is assuredly an important element; it is also learning the arts of investigation, criticism, discrimination and communication, skills which facilitate a lifetime of learning and social participation.\nThe work of a university cannot, therefore, be measured strictly in terms of courses, curricula, and examinations. Dewey wrote, \u201cThe only way to prepare for social life is to engage in social life.\u201d (Dewey, Moral Principles in Education (1909), p. 14, italics added.) As valuable as the pursuit of knowledge is for its own sake, the university also has a major responsibility for the development of an enlightened and engaged citizenry. Neglect this duty, and apathy and incivility will surely result.\nThomas Jefferson spoke often of the critical role higher education plays in preserving a republic of free, informed and self-reliant citizens. As he observed in characteristically pithy fashion: \u201cIf a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.\u201d Consistent with these views, Jefferson considered the founding of the University of Virginia to be among his most notable legacies, for the future of the nation ultimately depended on the knowledge and civic values of each succeeding generation. As the United States Supreme Court recently observed: \u201cEach generation must learn anew ... the ideas and aspirations\u201d which the Constitution\u2019s written terms embody. (Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) 505 U.S. _ , _ [120 L.Ed.2d 674, 730 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2833.] Foremost among these \u201clessons\u201d is the importance of toleration. \u201cTo endure the speech of false ideas . . . and then to counter it is part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society, a society which insists upon open discourse towards the end of a tolerant citizenry.\u201d (Lee v. Weisman (1992) 505 U.S. _ , _ [120 L.Ed.2d 467, 483 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2657.]\nAlthough these thoughts are conventional, their implications for the constitutional issues before us are significant. For if, as I believe, the nation\u2019s fundamental civic values are forged in the intellectual fires of its college campuses, then clearly the University\u2019s educational mission serves an important if not compelling governmental interest. And if, as I further believe, the ability to form and express one\u2019s own opinions and tolerate those of others lies at the heart of a free society, then the mandatory student fee clearly serves to effectuate this transcendent national interest, by contributing to the nearly limitless variety of speech and opinion on the university campus.\nWithout such funding, moreover, I have no doubt that the campus would lose much of the diversity which is its lifeblood. The practical realities cannot be ignored. The wherewithal to fund even a modest program lies beyond the limited means of most student groups. Remove the mandatory fee and centralized ASUC distribution, and binding would rapidly become a balkanized affair dependent on the vicissitudes of private donations and the fortuity of wealth. By divorcing the University from the funding process, furthermore, \u201cstudents would cease to be linked by a common bond to the tolerant support of all points of view.\u201d (Carroll v. Blinken, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 1002.) Therefore, I conclude that the modest mandatory fee which affords every student group the opportunity to sponsor films and speakers, to produce and distribute leaflets and flyers, is a reasonable and necessary means of effectuating the University\u2019s vital national mission.\nObviously, not all of the speech and activities funded by the mandatory student fee will be agreeable to all of the students all of the time. However, as Keller and Abood instruct, the critical question is not whether speech is controversial or commands the assent of every student, but whether it serves reasonably to effectuate the University\u2019s compelling educational mission. Subject to the limitations set forth below, I would hold that it does.\nE. Restrictions on the Use of the Mandatory Fee\nThe University\u2019s discretion to fund student activities through the mandatory fee is not without limit. On the contrary, as noted earlier the interests that justify the mandatory fee define the uses to which it may legitimately be put. The University\u2019s goal is to encourage a diversity of expression on campus, not to promote a particular ideological orthodoxy or partisan agenda. As the University\u2019s own policies provide, therefore, funding of student government and student activities groups and operations must be neutral and must not be used to support political candidates or ballot measures. Indeed, the use of such funds for partisan political purposes would violate the strictures of our holding in Stanson v. Mott (1976) 17 Cal.3d 206, 209-210 [130 Cal.Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1], that absent \u201cclear and explicit legislative authorization, a public agency may not expend public funds to promote a partisan position in an election campaign.\u201d\nNor should the mandatory fee be used to support student activities groups engaged in expressive activities off campus, including the currently funded ASUC lobbies. The purpose of the mandatory fee is to expose students to a diversity of views and to facilitate direct student participation in the University\u2019s ongoing intellectual discourse. Off-campus expression may be just as educational as on-campus speech for those involved, but the critical difference is that it benefits only those involved; it does not contribute to the campus discussion of ideas, and other students do not have the opportunity to hear and debate the views of off-campus speakers.\nFinally, inasmuch as the purpose of the University is to serve as a \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d in which students are encouraged to speak and participate, any use of the mandatory fees to interfere with such expression would also exceed the constitutional mandate. Thus, the University may properly deny funds to any group or activity which violates reasonable time, place and manner regulations or otherwise threatens to disrupt the educational process. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201cAssociational activities need not be tolerated when they infringe reasonable campus rules, interrupt classes, or substantially interfere with the opportunity of other students to obtain an education.\u201d (Healy v. James, supra, 408 U.S. 169, 189 [33 L.Ed.2d 266, 284].) For example, the funding of activities designed to deny access to a particular course or professor would exceed the constitutionally permissible uses of the mandatory student fee. And when advocacy presents an imminent threat to campus order through the promotion of racial genocide, for example, the University may properly deny recognition and funding. (Id. at pp. 189-192 [33 L.Ed.2d at pp. 284-286].)\nF. The Case Law Concerning Mandatory Student Fees\nThe foregoing analysis is consistent with every reported decision involving First Amendment challenges to the collection and use of a general mandatory student activities fee. Indeed, it closely tracks that of Judge Kaufman for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the most recent decision to date, Carroll v. Blinken, supra, 957 F.2d 991, 1001, certiorari denied_U.S. _[121 L.Ed.2d 224,113 S.Ct. 300]. There, state university students sought to enjoin as unconstitutional under Keller and Abood the use of a portion of their mandatory student fee ($55 per semester) to fund a particular student organization, the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG). There, as here, the federal court noted that the mandatory fee was used to fund a great variety of student groups, \u201cincluding athletic, social, recreational, service, ethnic and political organizations.\u201d (Id. at p. 993.) While acknowledging the First Amendment intrusion on dissenting students, the Court of Appeals concluded that the University\u2019s mission amply justified the infringement. \u201cA university where NYPIRG petitions against nuclear power, where environmental groups advocate greater recycling, where opponents of South Africa debate opponents of divestment, and partisans of a dozen other causes press their cases is a university fulfilling its traditional mission in a free society. Were it otherwise, college would be a very quiet, intellectually diminished and ultimately irrelevant place.\u201d (Id. at p. 1001.)\nAlthough the federal court thus upheld the use of the mandatory fee to support NYPIRG\u2019s on-campus activities, it disallowed the use of such funds for its off-campus lobbying and statewide administrative costs. As the court explained: \u201cStudents opposed to NYPIRG can be made to tolerate some compromise of their First Amendment rights when the benefits of a varied extracurricular life, hands-on civics training, and robust campus debate are all around them to approvingly take part in, actively oppose, or merely witness dispassionately firsthand. [Citations.] These benefits vanish when NYPIRG money is spent in the halls of the state legislature or at the main offices in New York City. SUNY Albany\u2019s interests, however substantial, are still, after all, those of the university and its community, not that of an independent statewide organization.\u201d (Carroll v. Blinken, supra, 957 F.2d at p. 1002.)\nKania v. Fordham, supra, 702 F.2d 475 also involved a challenge by state university students from the University of North Carolina to the use of their mandatory student fees. Relying on Abood, the students charged that the partial funding of a student newspaper compelled them to support views with which they disagreed, in violation of the First Amendment. The federal circuit court rejected the challenge, holding that \u201cfunding by mandatory student fees is the least restrictive means of accomplishing an important part of the University\u2019s central purpose, the education of its students.\u201d (Id. at p. 480.) In this regard, the court noted a \u201ccrucial distinction between Abood and the present case\u201d lay in the fact that the \u201cmandatory fees in Abood . . . enhanced the power of one, and only one, ideological group to further its political goals. In contrast, [the student newspaper] increases the overall exchange of information, ideas, and opinions on the campus.\u201d (Ibid.)\nAlthough rendered prior to Keller and Abood, a number of state decisions have also rejected First Amendment challenges to the use of mandatory student fees. In Larson v. Board of Regents of University of Neb. (1973) 189 Neb. 688 [204 N.W.2d 568], state university students relied on an important predecessor to Abood, International Machinists v. Street, supra, 367 U.S. 740, to challenge as unconstitutional the use of mandatory student fees to fund the student newspaper and speakers program, alleging that the \u201cmandatory fee system require[d] them to contribute to the support of political views and doctrines with which they disagree[d].\u201d (204 N.W.2d at p. 570.) Applying what was for all intents and purposes an Abood analysis, the Nebraska Supreme Court rejected the claim, concluding there were \u201cimportant distinction[s] between the political activities of a labor union and extracurricular activities at a university.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201cWithin reasonable limits, it is appropriate that many different points of view be presented to the students.\u201d (Id., 204 N.W.2d at p. 571.)\nLace v. University of Vermont (1973) 131 Vt. 170 [303 A.2d 475] is similar. There, state university students alleged that the use of their mandatory student fee, which funded over 100 student activities groups, a speakers bureau and the campus newspaper violated their First Amendment rights by compelling them to support \u201c \u2018persons advocating positions and views with which they wholly disagree.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at p. All) Distinguishing the labor union situation, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld the expenditures as a means of encouraging \u201cvarious and divergent student organizations to inject a spectrum of ideas into the campus community.\u201d (Id. at p. 479.) And in Good v. Associated Students of Univ. of Washington (1975) 86 Wn.2d 94 [542 P.2d 762], the Washington Supreme Court rejected a similar First Amendment challenge, holding that the use of a mandatory student fee to support a campus speakers bureau, student resolutions on contemporary political issues and other extracurricular activities groups served the paramount educational goal of promoting \u201can infinite range of ideas, theories and beliefs.\u201d\n(Id., 542 P.2d at p. 769; see also Arrington v. Taylor (M.D.N.C. 1974) 380 F.Supp. 1348, 1364 [distinguishing the use of mandatory student fees to provide \u201ca forum wherein others may express their views\u201d from the use of mandatory dues by a state bar or labor union]; Veed v. Schwartzkopf (D.Neb. 1973) 353 F.Supp. 149, affd. without opinion, 478 F.2d 1407 (8th Cir. 1973), cert, denied (1974) 414 U.S. 1135 [38 L.Ed.2d 760, 94 S.Ct. 878] [university is not constitutionally prohibited from use of mandatory student fees to support student association, newspaper and speakers program which provide a forum for the expression of divergent opinions]; see also Cantor, supra, 36 Rutgers L. Rev. at pp. 46-51; Note, \u201cFee Speech\u201d: First Amendment Limitations on Student Fee Expenditures (1984) 20 Cal. Western L. Rev. 279; Gibbs & Crisp, The Question of First Amendment Rights vs. Mandatory Student Activities Fees (1979) 8 J. L. & Ed. 185.).)\nGalda v. Rutgers (3d Cir. 1985) 772 F.2d 1060, on which plaintiffs chiefly rely, is inapposite. There, the court held that a separate mandatory fee imposed for the sole purpose of supporting one organization, the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group (NJPIRG), which was otherwise ineligible to receive money from the general student activities fee because it was an independent rather than a student organization, infringed the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights. In so ruling, however, the Galda court emphasized that its holding was \u201ca narrow one and may perhaps best be explained by eliminating what is not at stake. This case does not address the problem presented by a state university\u2019s allocation of a mandatory non-refundable student activity fee. We are not concerned here with the question whether an organization with [NJ] PERG\u2019s philosophic outlook may be funded through the general activities fund as are other campus organizations representing diverse views. [][] In short, we do not enter the controversy on whether a given campus organization may participate in the general activities fee despite the objections of some who are required to contribute to that fund. See, e.g., Kania v. Fordham, 702 F.2d 475 (4th Cir. 1983 . . . .\u201d (Id. at p. 1064, italics added.)\nGalda v. Rutgers, supra, 772 F.2d 1060, held only that a separate assessment to support one organization which expressed only one viewpoint violated the First Amendment rights of dissenting students. In so holding, it again emphasized the distinction between the special funding of NJPIRG, and the traditional funding of campus groups through a general student activities fee. As the court explained: \u201cThere is room for argument that a university\u2019s role of presenting a variety of ideas is a sufficiently compelling reason for some infringement of First Amendment rights just as is the need for labor peace in the union dues cases. That contention loses its force, however, when an outside organization independent of a university and dedicated to advancing one position, is entitled to compelled contributions .... In that situation a university\u2019s ability to insure a balance in access is infringed, if not prevented, in some circumstances and the quid pro quo for payment to a forum disappears, [f] Generally, when an activity fund comes into existence, all student groups on campus are free to compete for a fair share. That is not the situation here where the mandated contribution is earmarked for only one organization, an organization which has no obligation to use any part of the fund for the benefit of a group which pursues a different philosophy.\u201d (772 F.2d at p. 1067, italics added.)\nWe are not confronted here with a separate mandatory assessment earmarked for one independent organization, but rather a general student activities fee in which \u201call student groups on campus are free to compete for a fair share.\u201d (Galda v. Rutgers, supra, 772 F.2d at p. 1067.) Thus, as Galda itself repeatedly emphasizes, that case is not apposite to our decision.\nG. Constitutionally Compelled Administrative Procedures\nThe analysis does not end with the conclusion that certain activities may be funded through the mandatory student fee and others may not. As noted earlier, the United States Supreme Court has outlined a minimum set of procedures by which a union or integrated bar may meet its constitutionally compelled requirement of assuring that compulsory dues are not expended on nongermane activities. The high court summarized these procedures in Chicago Teachers v. Hudson, supra, 475 U.S. 292, as follows: \u201c[T]he constitutional requirements for the Union\u2019s collection of agency fees include an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee, a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision-maker, and an escrow for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending.\u201d (Id. at p. 310 [89 L.Ed.2d at p. 249]; see Keller v. State Bar, supra, 496 U.S. at pp. 16-17 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 15-16]; see also Gibson v. The Florida Bar (11th Cir. 1990) 906 F.2d 624, 627-633, cert. granted Mar. 18, 1991, cert. dism. as improv. granted Dec. 4, 1991.)\nAs discussed above, the University\u2019s discretion to fund student activities through the mandatory fee is not without constitutional limits. These include expenditures to support partisan political candidates or ballot measures, off-campus activities, and activities which interfere with the freedom of expression of other members of the campus community. Students who believe that a proposed expenditure violates these constitutional restrictions should have a convenient and expedient means of challenging it. Although we do not have a fully developed record regarding the University\u2019s fee setting and collection process, I believe, as the high court observed in Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1, that the University \u201ccould certainly meet its Abood obligation by adopting the sort of procedures described in Hudson.\u201d (496 U.S. at p. 17 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 16].) I note in this regard that the ASUC already prepares a detailed annual budget, including line item expenditures of student activities groups, which must be reviewed and approved by the ASUC Senate and the University. An appropriate remedial system would provide for general notice of the approved budget, the opportunity to file a written objection to a particular expenditure within a specified time period, an escrow for the pro rata amount of the objecting students\u2019 fees at issue pending determination of the merits of the objection, and an impartial arbitration panel. (See Gibson v. The Florida Bar, supra, 906 F.2d at pp. 627-632.) As in Keller, however, I would leave open the question whether one or more alternative procedures tailored to the University\u2019s unique conditions would likewise satisfy its constitutional obligations. (496 U.S. at p. 17 [110 L.Ed.2d at p. 16].)\nH. Authority to Impose the Student Fee\nPlaintiffs also assert that the University lacks the requisite statutory and constitutional authority to impose a mandatory student activities fee. Several grounds are advanced to support this claim. As will appear, none is meritorious.\nOriginally created by statute in 1867 (Stats. 1867-1868, ch. CCXLIV, p. 248), the University of California achieved constitutional status in 1879. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9.) The California Constitution declares the University of California to be a \u201cpublic trust\u201d and places its governance in the hands of the Regents. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9, subd. (a).) The Regents are vested with \u201cthe legal title and the management and disposition of the property of the university . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9, subd. (f).) The Regents\u2019 authority includes \u201call the powers necessary or convenient for the effective administration of its trust, including the power ... to delegate to its committees or to the faculty of the university, or to others, such authority or functions as it may deem wise. . . .\u201d (Ibid.) The courts have construed this constitutional authority as giving the Regents \u201cvirtual autonomy in self-governance.\u201d (Regents of University of California v. City of Santa Monica (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 130, 135 [143 Cal.Rptr. 276]; accord, Cal. State Employees\u2019 Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 667, 671 [73 Cal.Rptr. 449].) As we have stated: \u201c[T]he power of the Regents to operate, control and administer the University is virtually exclusive.\u201d (San Francisco Labor Council v. Regents of University of California (1980) 26 Cal.3d 785, 788 [163 Cal.Rptr. 460, 608 P.2d 277], internal quotation marks omitted.)\nIn light of these provisions, plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the University lacks the requisite authority to impose a mandatory student fee is patently without merit. The Legislature has expressly authorized the creation of a student body organization and the collection of mandatory student activities fees for the California State University system. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 89300.) The funds collected may be used \u201cfor such purposes of the student body organization as are approved by the trustees.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 89302.) Although parallel statutory provisions are not provided for the University, none is needed. The University is a constitutional entity whose powers derive therefrom. The Regents\u2019 authority to exercise \u201call the powers necessary or convenient for the effective administration of its trust, including the power ... to delegate to its committees or to the faculty of the university, or to others, such authority or functions, as it may deem wise. . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9, subds. (a), (f)) plainly encompasses the power to authorize the adoption, by a vote of two-thirds of the student body, a mandatory activities fee similar to that of the state college system.\nPlaintiffs further contend that the Regents have exceeded their constitutional mandate by delegating to the ASUC, which they characterize as a \u201cprivate entity,\u201d the authority to administer and manage the student funds. On the contrary, the ASUC is clearly a creature of the University; the Regents authorized it, and retain ultimate responsibility for its supervision of student affairs. The chancellor, by virtue of the authority of the Regents, regularly monitors the ASUC Senate and oversees and approves the annual ASUC budget. Moreover, under the University\u2019s written policies, the chancellor is empowered to \u201cmake audits of the finances of student governments, exercise control over expenditure of their funds . . . and where necessary may take action to ensure that any activity under control of student governments is operated in accordance with sound practices . . .\u201d Thus, the ASUC plainly acts under the authority and close supervision of the Regents and the University.\nRelying on this court\u2019s decision in Stanson v. Mott, supra, 17 Cal.3d 206, petitioners further contend that the University lacks clear and explicit authority to use public funds for partisan campaign purposes. Stanson held that a public agency requires \u201cclear and explicit\u201d legislative authority to engage in what it characterized as \u201cinformational\u201d lobbying (id. at pp. 209-210), and suggested, without holding, that the use of public funds for partisan campaigning presented a \u201cserious constitutional question.\u201d (Id. at p. 219.) Applying these principles, we held that the Director of the California Department of Parks and Recreation had exceeded his authority in authorizing the expenditure of more than $5,000 of public funds to promote passage of a bond issue for the acquisition of park land and recreational facilities. (Id. at p. 220.)\nAlthough the ASUC Senate may adopt resolutions on political issues, the University does not sanction the expenditure of ASUC revenues to fund partisan election campaigning. Moreover, as previously noted, there is clear and express constitutional authority authorizing the expenditure of funds for the ASUC student government. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 9, subd. (f).) Stanson v. Mott, supra, 17 Cal.3d 206, is thus inapposite.\nPlaintiffs also assert that use of the mandatory activities fee to subsidize student religious groups violates the establishment clause (U.S. Const., Amend. I; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 4.) and article IX, section 9, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution, which states that the University \u201cshall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence ...\u201d As earlier noted, the trial court made a factual finding, sustained by the record, that while some religious groups had registered with the University, no group whose activities are essentially religious in nature, i.e., devoted to proselytizing, conducting religious services or restricting membership to persons of a particular faith, had received ASUC funds. Nor has the University violated the constitutional injunction against political \u201cinfluence.\u201d This section, by its terms, proscribes partisan interference in the internal affairs of the University, not political activity by the University. Moreover, as previously discussed, the ASUC may not fund activities designed to advance partisan political positions. Thus, the mandatory student fee does not contravene the political neutrality clause.\nConclusion\nThe Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, \u201cMorality cannot be legislated but behavior can be regulated. Judicial decrees may not change the heart, but they can restrain the heartless.\u201d\nOur role as guardians of the law and of the Constitution charges us with the duty of safeguarding against unwarranted encroachments of others\u2019 rights by those who require restraint.\nWe are given here the solemn opportunity of enriching the spirit of liberty by shielding all persons against the imposition of an educational philosophy based on cynicism and divisiveness by fashioning a decree which fosters the concept of community as opposed to constructing a wall of separatism. This we have failed to do. We have lost the light of wisdom and diminished our noble heritage.\nI acknowledge that the resolution of conflicting interests that I have set forth may not satisfy those who prefer First Amendment absolutes. I believe, however, that it is faithful to the principles of Keller and Abood, fair to both the University\u2019s and the nation\u2019s needs, and mindful of petitioners\u2019 right to be free of that compelled speech not germane to those concerns. Therefore, subject to the limitations previously discussed, I would affirm the judgment of tiie Court of Appeal.\nMosk, J., concurred.\nRespondents\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied April 15, 1993, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Mosk, J., and Arabian, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.\nIt is important to state clearly that the issue here turns on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and not its state equivalent, article I, section 2, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution. The majority note that plaintiffs raised the state provision in their complaint, but give no indication that plaintiffs failed to discuss the state provision in their Court of Appeal briefs, failed to raise the state provision in their petitions for review, and failed to cite, argue or discuss the state provision in their subsequent briefs on the merits. Thus, the state provision was not preserved for review on appeal, and therefore forms no independent basis of the court\u2019s decision.\nAbood represented the culmination of a line of decisions beginning with Railway Employes\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson (1956) 351 U.S. 225 [100 L.Ed. 1112, 76 S.Ct. 714] and progressing through Railway Clerks v. Allen (1963) 373 U.S. 113 [10 L.Ed.2d 235, 83 S.Ct. 1158] and International Machinists v. Street (1961) 367 U.S. 740 [6 L.Ed.2d 1141, 81 S.Ct. 1784] in which the court upheld federal legislation authorizing union shop agreements and the imposition of compulsory dues on the grounds that it promoted industrial peace and distributed fairly the cost of union activities to those who benefit, but reserved the constitutional questions posed by the expenditure of mandatory dues for purposes not germane to collective bargaining.\nIn concluding that the mandatory student fee is subject to strict scrutiny, the majority simply ignore the fact that the United States Supreme Court expressly applied a middle-tier standard of review in the two leading mandatory dues cases, Keller, supra, 496 U.S. 1 and Abood, supra, 431 U.S. 209. However, even assuming for the sake of argument that strict scrutiny applies, I would hold that the mandatory student fee serves a compelling governmental interest, and is narrowly tailored to achieve its goal.\nThere was testimony, for example, that the League of Arab Students had used ASUC funds to distribute leaflets in support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the UC Polish Dance Club had used ASUC funds to sponsor speakers on current issues in Poland.\nThe Great Quotations (Seldes ed. 1983) page 367.\nI note, in passing, that infringements of the nature at issue here occur routinely at a university; indeed, they can hardly be avoided. When a university hires a professor based, in part, on his or her academic philosophy, when it selects courses for inclusion in the curriculum, when it invites speakers from outside the academic community to address issues of public interest, it necessarily expends funds provided by students to promote speech and ideas which some students may oppose. (See Kama v. Fordham (4th Cir. 1983) 702 F.2d 475, 480, fn. 9.) So long as the university neither seeks by these expenditures to impose a particular ideological orthodoxy nor to stifle intellectual debate, such educational judgments cannot justifiably be questioned.\nAlthough the trial court found \u201cisolated instances in the past\u201d where the rule against funding partisan activities had been violated, it concluded that the relatively few infractions and the absence of any \u201cpattern of neglect or likelihood of recurrence\u201d militated against equitable relief. The award of declaratory or injunctive relief is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion. (Cohen v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 40 Cal.3d 277, 286 [219 Cal.Rptr. 467, 707 P.2d 840]; In re Marriage of Connolly (1979) 23 Cal.3d 590, 598 [153 Cal.Rptr. 423,591 P.2d 911].) The test is whether the trial court \u201cexceeded the bounds of all reason, all of the circumstances before it being considered.\u201d (In re Marriage of Connolly, supra, 23 Cal.3d at p. 598; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1060, 1061.) Here, in light of the findings that the infractions relating to partisan funding were de minimis and would not be repeated, I cannot say that the trial court clearly abused its discretion in denying relief.\nOff-campus activities that are not designed to facilitate speech in any meaningful sense, such as travel expenses incurred by the Berkeley Chess Club to attend a chess match at another campus, may continue to be funded as they do not raise First Amendment concerns relating to compelled speech.\nContrary to the implication in the majority opinion, the Court of Appeals in Carroll did not premise its holding on the fact that NYPIRG promoted \u201ceducational\u201d rather than \u201cideological\u201d causes. On the contrary, the Carroll court recognized that despite its self-description as \u201cnon-partisan\u201d NYPIRG pursued clearly political ends, as did the \u201cpartisans of a dozen other causes\u201d on campus. (957 F.2d at p. 1001.) Nevertheless, the court concluded that such groups were integral to the university\u2019s goal of \u201cfulfilling its traditional mission in a free society.\u201d (Ibid.)\nThe majority are correct that the Carroll court \u201cbalanced\u201d the benefits that NYPIRG and other activities groups offered to students against the infringement of the dissenting students\u2019 rights. But contrary to the majority\u2019s implication, the Carroll court weighed the balance in favor of the university, holding that funding such \u201cathletic, social, recreational, service, ethnic and political organizations\u201d served sufficiently important interests to justify the infringement. (957 F.2d at p. 993.)\nSee footnote 2, ante, at page 875.\nIn light of Galda's clear, repeated and unequivocal statements that it was not considering the problem represented by a general student activities fee (772 F.2d at p. 1064), and its intimation that it would uphold such a fee if the issue were presented (id. at p. 1067), the majority\u2019s statement (maj. opn., ante, at p. 858) that \u201cthere is nothing in the Third Circuit\u2019s approach that prevents its application to on-campus student groups\u201d defies comprehension.\nPlaintiffs also cite section 13 of the Organic Act establishing the University of California (Stats. 1867-1868, ch. CCXLIV, \u00a7 13, p. 254), which provided in pertinent part: \u201c[N]o sectarian, political or partisan test shall ever be allowed or exercised in the appointment of Regents, or in the election of professors, teachers, or other officers of the University, or in the admission of students thereto, or for any purpose whatsoever . . . Although the Organic Act was expressly incorporated into the 1879 version of article IX, section 9 of the California Constitution, a 1918 constitutional amendment deleted any reference thereto. Plaintiffs nevertheless urge that the provisions of the Organic Act remain in effect. Even assuming, without purporting to decide, that this is the case, the record is barren of any evidence that students are subject to \u201cpolitical, sectarian or political\u201d tests for admission.",
